The phallic Gherkin’s futuristic, sci-fi exterior has become an emblem of modern London as recognisable as Big Ben or the London Eye. Built in 2002–03 to a multi-award-winning design by Norman Foster, this is London’s first ecofriendly skyscraper: Foster laid out the offices so they spiral around internal ‘sky gardens’. The windows can be opened and the gardens are used to reprocess stale air, so air-conditioning is kept to a minimum. Its primary fuel source is gas, low-energy lighting is used throughout the building and the design maximises the amount of natural light let into the building, meaning that less electricity is used. Its 41 floors mainly house the reinsurance giant Swiss Re’s London offices, and tours are not currently possible. The gorgeous top-floor restaurant is usually open only to staff and their guests, but it’s possible to gain access by booking one of the private dining rooms, although this will need to be done well in advance. In some years mere mortals are granted access when the Gherkin participates in the superb <strong>Open House Weekend</strong>, an annual September event. When included, the Gherkin is always one of the most popular venues."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370431","id":"370431","name":"333","type":"Night","subtype":"Music","latitude":51.5271488171118,"longitude":-0.0804448127747,"hours":"10pm-5am Fri, 10pm-4am Sat & Sun","address":{"street":"333 Old St","postcode":"EC1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7739 5949","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7739 5949"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.333mother.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Old St"}],"review":{"summary":"Hoxton’s true old-timer, 333’s stripped-down manner doesn’t bow to Shoreditch’s silly cool and just keeps going, despite not being what it once was in terms of pulling power.

Still one of London’s finest but overlooking the nightmarish Hyde Park Corner roundabout, Apsley House was designed by Robert Adam for Baron Apsley in the late 18th century, but was later sold to the first Duke of Wellington, who cut Napoleon down to size in the Battle of Waterloo and lived here for 35 years until his death in 1852. In 1947 the house was given to the nation, which must have come as a surprise to the duke’s descendants who still live in a flat here; 10 of its rooms are open to the public and visited on a self-paced audio-guide tour. Wellington memorabilia, including the Iron Duke’s medals, some entertaining old cartoons and his death mask, fill the basement gallery, while there’s an astonishing collection of china, including some of his personal silverware, on the ground floor. The stairwell is dominated by Antonio Canova’s staggering 3.4m-high statue of a fig-leafed Napoleon, adjudged by the subject as ‘too athletic’. The 1st-floor Wellington Gallery contains paintings by Velasquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, Brueghel and Murillo, but the most interesting is Goya’s portrait of the duke, which some years ago was discovered to have the face of Napoleon’s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, beneath the duke’s. Apparently, the artist had taken a punt on Napoleon winning the Battle of Waterloo and had to do a quick ‘about face’ when news of Wellington’s victory arrived."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1092962","id":"1092962","name":"APT Gallery","type":"See","latitude":51.47685016,"longitude":-0.020783334,"address":{"street":"6 Creekside","postcode":"SE8"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8694 8344","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8694 8344"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.aptstudios.org"],"transports":[],"review":{"summary":"Creekside street running parallel to Deptford Creek is lined with galleries and artists’ studios that have regularly changing art exhibitions, including <strong>APT Gallery</strong>."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370379","id":"370379","name":"Aquarium","type":"Night","subtype":"Club","latitude":51.5258738975307,"longitude":-0.0854015350342,"hours":"10pm-3am Sat, 10pm-4am Sun","price_string":"admission varies depending on the night","price_range":"2","address":{"street":"256-264 Old St","postcode":"EC1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7253 3558","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7253 3558"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.clubaquarium.co.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Old St"}],"review":{"summary":"The Saturday-night hitch-up between ‘70s disco evening Carwash and this converted gym seems like a great match: clubbers dressed in sexy, retro gear – compulsory, but disco wigs not allowed – now mingle around the huge pool or in the trendy bar.

A Scottish merchant by the name of William Paterson came up with the idea of forming a joint-stock bank that could lend the government money and, in 1694, so began the Bank of England and the notion of national debt. The bank rapidly expanded in size and stature and moved to this site in 1734. During a financial crisis at the end of the 18th century, a cartoon appeared depicting the bank as a haggard old woman, and this is probably the origin of its nickname ‘the Old Lady of Threadneedle St’, which has stuck ever since. The institution is now in charge of maintaining the integrity of the British currency and financial system – and, since Gordon Brown, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave it the power in 1997, even sets interest rates. The gifted Sir John Soane built the original structure, although the governors saw fit to demolish most of his splendid bank in the early 20th century and replace it with a utilitarian, no-frills model that they would soon regret. The centrepiece of the museum – which explores the evolution of money and the history of this venerable institution, and which is not <em>nearly</em> as dull as it sounds, even if it’s no substitute for some of London’s more essential museums – is a postwar reconstruction of Soane’s original stock office complete with mannequins in period dress behind original mahogany counters. A series of rooms leading off the office are packed with exhibits ranging from photographs and coins to a gold bar you can lift up (it’s amazingly heavy) and the muskets once used to defend the bank."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371071","id":"371071","name":"Bankside Gallery","type":"See","subtype":"Art Gallery","latitude":51.5081440366,"longitude":-0.101094582159,"hours":"11am-6pm","price_string":"admission free","price_range":"1","address":{"street":"48 Hopton St","postcode":"SE1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7928 7521","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7928 7521"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.banksidegallery.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"St Paul’s, Southwark or London Bridge"}],"review":{"summary":"Home of the Royal Watercolour Society and the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers, this friendly upbeat place has no permanent collection, but there are frequently changing exhibitions of watercolours, prints and engravings.

Apparently, the English hated it for more than a century. A bust outside commemorates 30 January 1649 when Charles I, accused of treason by Cromwell after the Civil War, was executed on a scaffold built against a 1st-floor window here. When the monarchy was reinstated with Charles II, it inevitably became something of a royalist shrine. In a huge, virtually unfurnished hall on the 1st floor there are nine ceiling panels painted by Rubens in 1635. They were commissioned by Charles I and depict the ‘divine right’ of kings.

While the Barbican is named after a Roman fortification protecting ancient Londinium that may once have stood here, what you see here today is very much a product of the 1960s and ‘70s. Built on a huge bombsite abandoned since WWII and opened progressively between 1969 and 1982, it’s fair to say that its brutalist concrete isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. Yet, although it topped several recent polls as London’s ugliest building, many Londoners see something very beautiful about its cohesion and ambition – incorporating Shakespeare’s local church, <strong>St Giles Cripplegate</strong>, into its brave-new-world design and embellishing its public areas with lakes and ponds. With a £7-million refit bringing the complex a much-needed facelift in 2005, the Barbican is much better loved than London’s other modernist colossus, the South Bank Centre. Trendy urban architects have long prized apartments here, and the residences in the three high-rise towers that ring the cultural centre are some of the city’s most sought-after living spaces. Home of the London Symphony Orchestra and one of the best places to see dance in the capital, the Barbican is still London’s pre-eminent cultural centre, boasting three cinemas that show a combination of commercial and independent films, two theatres, which feature touring drama as well as dance performances, and the highly regarded <strong>Barbican Gallery</strong>, which stages excellent temporary exhibitions.

At a cost of £500 million, it was Britain’s most expensive building, and not one that is universally loved; Colin St John Wilson’s exterior of straight lines of red brick, which Prince Charles reckoned was akin to a ‘secret-police building’, is certainly not to all tastes. But even people who don’t like the building from the outside can’t fault the spectacularly cool and spacious interior. It is the nation’s principal copyright library and stocks one copy of every British publication as well as historic manuscripts, books and maps from the British Museum. The library counts some 186 miles of shelving on four basement levels and will have some 12 million volumes when it reaches the limit of its storage capacity. At the centre of the building is the wonderful <strong>King’s Library</strong>, the 65,000-volume collection of the insane George III, which was given to the nation by his son, George IV, in 1823 and is now housed in a six-storey, 17m-high glass-walled tower. To the left as you enter are the library’s excellent bookshop and exhibition galleries. Most of the complex is devoted to storage and scholarly research, but there are also several public displays including the <strong>John Ritblat Gallery: Treasures of the British Library</strong>, which spans almost three millennia and every continent. Among the most important documents here are the Magna Carta (1215); the Codex Sinaiticus, the first complete text of the New Testament, written in Greek in the 4th century; a Gutenberg Bible (1455), the first Western book printed using movable type; Shakespeare’s First Folio (1623); manuscripts by some of Britain’s best-known authors (eg Lewis Carroll, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Thomas Hardy); and even some of the Beatles’ earliest handwritten lyrics. You can hear historic recordings, such as the first one ever, made by Thomas Edison in 1877, James Joyce reading from <em>Ulysses</em> and Nelson Mandela’s famous speech at the Rivonia trial in 1964, at the <strong>National Sound Archive Jukeboxes</strong>, where the selections are changed regularly. The <strong>Turning the Pages</strong> exhibit allows you a ‘virtual browse’ through several important texts including the <em>Sforza Book of Hours,</em> the <em>Diamond Sutra</em> and a Leonardo da Vinci notebook. The <strong>Philatelic Exhibition</strong>, next to the John Ritblat Gallery, is based on collections established in 1891 with the bequest of the Tapling Collection, and now consists of more than 80,000 items, including postage and revenue stamps, postal stationery and first-day covers from almost every country and from all periods. The <strong>Workshop of Words, Sounds &amp; Images</strong> documents the development of writing and communicating through the written word by carefully examining the work of early scribes, printers and bookbinders. The sound section compares recordings on different media, from early-20th-century wax cylinders to modern CDs. Access to the reading rooms is by reader’s pass only. See the website for details of how to apply for one and the conditions that need to be met. There are <strong>guided tours</strong> of the library’s public areas at 3pm Monday, Wednesday and Friday and at 10.30am and 3pm Saturday, and another that includes a visit to one of the <strong>reading rooms</strong> 01937-546 546 to make a booking.

One of the world’s oldest and finest museums, the British Museum started in 1749 in the form of royal physician Hans Sloane’s ‘cabinet of curiosities’ – which he later bequeathed to the country – and carried on expanding its collection (which now numbers some seven million items) through judicious acquisition and the controversial plundering of empire. It’s an exhaustive and exhilarating stampede through world cultures, with galleries devoted to Egypt, Western Asia, Greece, the Orient, Africa, Italy, the Etruscans, the Romans, prehistoric and Roman Britain and medieval antiquities. The museum is huge, so make a few focused visits if you have time, and consider the choice of tours. There are nine free 50-minute <strong>eyeOpener tours</strong> of individual galleries throughout the day, and 20-minute <strong>eyeOpener spotlight talks</strong> at 1.15pm focusing on different themes from the collection. Ninety-minute <strong>highlights tours</strong> leave at 10.30am, 1pm and 3pm. If you want to go it alone, <strong>audioguide tours</strong> are available at the information desk, including a family-oriented one narrated by comedian, writer and TV presenter Stephen Fry. One specific to the Parthenon Sculptures (aka the Parthenon Marbles or Elgin Marbles) is available in that gallery. You could also check out Compass, a multimedia public access system with 50 computer terminals that lets you take a virtual tour of the museum, plan your own circuit or get information on specific exhibits.

It is dominated by the 25m-high <strong>Queen Victoria Memorial</strong> at the end of The Mall. Tickets for the palace are on sale from the <strong>Ticket Office</strong> at the Visitor Entrance, Buckingham Palace Rd. After a series of crises and embarrassing revelations in the early 1990s, the royal spin doctors cranked things up a gear to try to revive popular support, and it was decided to swing open the doors of Buck House to the public for the first time. Well, to 19 of the 661 rooms, at least. And only during August and September, when HRH is holidaying in Scotland. And for a veritable king’s ransom, but still, we mustn’t quibble – no price is too great for an opportunity to see the Windsors’ polaroids plastered all over the fridge door. The ‘working rooms’ are stripped down each summer for the arrival of the commoners, and the usual carpet is replaced with industrial-strength rugs, so the rooms don’t look all that lavish. The tour starts in the Guard Room (too small for the Ceremonial Guard, who actually use adjoining quarters); allows a peek inside the State Dining Room (all red damask and Regency furnishings); then moves on to the Blue Drawing Room, with a gorgeous fluted ceiling by John Nash; to the White Drawing Room, where foreign ambassadors are received; and to the Ballroom, where official receptions and state banquets are held. The Throne Room is pretty hilarious with kitschy his-and-hers pink chairs initialled ‘ER’ and ‘P’, sitting smugly under what looks like a theatre arch. The most interesting part of the tour (for all but royal sycophants) is the 76.5m-long Picture Gallery, featuring splendid works by artists such as Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Canaletto, Poussin, Canova and Vermeer, although the likes of these and much more are yours for free at the National Gallery. Wandering the gardens is another highlight here – it’s bound to give you a real royal feeling.

Of course, it’s too late to see author Jeffrey Archer being found guilty of perjury here, watch the Guildford Four’s convictions being quashed after their wrongful imprisonment for IRA terrorist attacks or view the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe being sent down. However, the Old Bailey is a byword for crime and notoriety. So even if you sit in on a fairly run-of-the-mill trial, simply being in the court where such people as the Kray twins and Oscar Wilde (in an earlier building on this site) once appeared is memorable in itself. Choose from 18 courts, of which the oldest – courts 1, 2 and 3 – usually have the most interesting cases. As cameras, video equipment, mobile phones, large bags and food and drink are all forbidden inside, and there are no cloakrooms or lockers, it’s important not to take these with you. Take a cardigan or something to cushion the hard seats though, and if you’re interested in a high-profile trial, get there early. The Central Criminal Court gets its nickname from the street on which it stands: <em>baillie</em> was Norman French for ‘enclosed courtyard’. The current building opened in 1907 on the combined site of a previous Old Bailey and Newgate Prison. Intriguingly, the figure of justice holding a sword and scales in her hands above the building’s copper dome is <em>not</em> blindfolded (against undue influence, as is traditionally the case). That’s a situation that has sparked many a sarcastic comment from those being charged here."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1038239","id":"1038239","name":"Central YMCA","type":"Do","subtype":"Health/Fitness","latitude":51.5172522348575,"longitude":-0.1307120919228,"price_string":"membership per day/week £15/50","address":{"street":"112 Great Russell St","postcode":"WC1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7343 1700","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7343 1700"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.centralymca.org.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Tottenham Court Rd"}],"review":{"summary":"The gym at London’s YMCA is popular and busy.

The monastery was founded in 1371 by the Carthusians, the strictest of all Roman Catholic monastic orders, who refrained from eating meat and took vows of silence, broken only for three hours on Sunday. During the Reformation the monastery was oppressed, with at least three priors hanged at <strong>Tyburn</strong> and a dozen monks sent to Newgate, where they were chained upright and died of starvation. King Henry VIII confiscated the monastery in 1537, and it was purchased in 1611 by Thomas Sutton, known at the time as the ‘richest commoner in England’. Sutton – of <strong>Sutton House</strong> fame – opened an almshouse for destitute gentlemen; some three dozen pensioners (known as ‘brothers’) live here today and lead the tours.

The dome of the main salon has been left ungilded and the walls are decorated with eight enormous paintings. In the Blue Velvet Room look for the portrait of Inigo Jones, the architect much admired by Lord Burlington, over one of the doors. The ceiling paintings are by William Kent, who also decorated the Kensington Palace State Apartments. Lord Burlington also planned the house’s original gardens, now Chiswick Park surrounding the house, but they have been much altered since his time. The gardens started being restored in March 2008, followed by the restoration of the conservatory and café in 2009. The work aims to be completed by spring 2010.

This whizz-bang multimedia Churchill Museum joins the highly evocative Cabinet War Rooms, where chiefs of staff slept, ate and plotted Hitler’s downfall, blissfully believing they were protected from Luftwaffe bombs by the 3m slab of concrete overhead. (Turns out it would have crumpled like paper had the area taken a hit.) Together, these two sections make you forget the Churchill who was a maverick and lousy peacetime politician, and drive home how much the cigar-chewing, wartime PM was a case of right man, right time. The Churchill Museum contains all sorts of posters, trivia and personal effects, from the man’s cigars to a ‘British bulldog’ vase in his image, and from his formal Privy Council uniform to his shockingly tasteless red velvet ‘romper’ outfit. Even though the museum doesn’t shy away from its hero’s fallibilities, it does begin with his strongest suit – his stirring speeches, replayed for each goosebumped visitor who steps in front of the screen. ‘I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat’, ‘We will fight them on the beaches’, ‘Never in the course of human history has so much been owed by so many to so few’. Elsewhere, silver-tongued Winnie even gets credit for inspiring Orson Welles’ famous rant about Switzerland and cuckoo clocks, with a speech he made to Parliament several years before <em>The Third Man</em> was filmed. There’s fantastically edited footage of Churchill’s 1965 state funeral, making the April 2005 burial of Pope John Paul II look like a low-key family affair, and you can check on what the PM was doing nearly every day beforehand via the huge tabletop interactive lifeline. Touch on a particular year on the screen and it will open up into months and days for you to choose. In stark contrast, the old Cabinet War Rooms have been left much as they were when the lights were turned off on VJ Day in August 1945 and everyone headed off for a well-earned drink. The room where the Cabinet held more than 100 meetings, the Telegraph Room with a hotline to Roosevelt, the cramped typing pool, the converted broom cupboard that was Churchill’s office and scores of bedrooms have all been preserved. You will pass the broadcast niche where Churchill made four of his rousing speeches to the nation, including one about Germany fuelling ‘a fire in British hearts’ by launching the London Blitz. In the Chief of Staff’s Conference Room, the walls are covered with huge, original maps that were only discovered in 2002. If you squint two-thirds of the way down the right wall, somebody (Churchill himself?) drew a little doodle depicting a cross-eyed and bandy-legged Hitler knocked on his arse. The free audioguide is very informative and entertaining and features plenty of anecdotes, including some from people who worked here in the nerve centre of Britain’s war effort – and weren’t even allowed by their irritable boss to relieve the tension by whistling."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093177","id":"1093177","name":"Churreria Española","type":"Eat","latitude":51.51615836,"longitude":-0.188865117,"hours":"8am-8pm Mon-Fri, from 9am Sat & Sun","price_string":"mains £5.95-8.95","address":{"street":"177-179 Queensway","postcode":"W2"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7727 3444","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7727 3444"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bayswater"}],"review":{"summary":"This extremely popular cafe with the open frontage serves a variety of cheap dishes, from English breakfasts to a range of Spanish tapas (£2.25 to £4.50)."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371259","id":"371259","name":"Chutney's","type":"Eat","subtype":"Indian","latitude":51.5268745422363,"longitude":-0.1377286314964,"price_range":"1","address":{"street":"124 Drummond St","locality":"Camden","postcode":"NW1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7388 0604","text":"tel, info","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7388 0604"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Warren St or Euston Square"}],"review":{"summary":"<p>Although, like Brick Lane, the South Indian restaurants along Drummond St have seen a decline in standards, the drop is not so pronounced, and Chutney's continues to provide good, cheap all-you-can-eat vegetarian buffets.</p>"},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370731","id":"370731","name":"Ciné Lumière","type":"Night","subtype":"Cinema","latitude":51.49426,"longitude":-0.17712,"address":{"street":"17 Queensberry Pl","postcode":"SW7"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7073 1350","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7073 1350"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.institut-francais.org.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"South Kensington"}],"review":{"summary":"Ciné Lumière is attached South Kensington’s French Institute, and its large art deco <em>salle</em> (cinema) screens great international seasons and French and other foreign films subtitled in English.

However, while they see the fabulous restored Georgian interiors, with meals and drinks half-abandoned and rumpled sheets, and while they smell cooking and hear creaking floorboards, their ‘hosts’ always remain tantalisingly just out of reach. It’s a unique and intriguing proposition by day, but ‘Silent Night’ tours by candlelight every Monday evening (bookings essential) are even more memorable. Dennis Severs’ House is not the only fine Georgian house in Folgate St, north of Spitalfields market: the street is lined with them, and they too were once occupied by the Huguenots who fled religious persecution in France to settle here in the late 17th century, bringing with them their skills as silk weavers.

All around it today huge office blocks loom and tiny Gough Sq can be quite hard to find as a result. The house has been preserved, of course, as it was the home of the great Georgian wit Samuel Johnson, the author of the first serious dictionary of the English language (transcribed by a team of six clerks in the attic) and the man who proclaimed ‘When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life’. The museum doesn’t exactly crackle with Dr Johnson’s immortal wit, yet it’s still an atmospheric and worthy place to visit, with its antique furniture and artefacts from Johnson’s life (his brick from the Great Wall of China must surely be the oddest of these). The numerous paintings of Dr Johnson and his associates, including his black manservant Francis Barber and his clerk and biographer James Boswell, are, sadly, not particularly revealing of the great minds who would have considered the building a home from home. A more revealing object is a chair from Johnson’s local pub, the Old Cock Tavern on Fleet St. There’s a rather ponderous video, plus leaflets telling how the lexicographer and six clerks (Boswell wasn’t among them, yet) developed the first English dictionary in the house’s attic during the period he lived here from 1748 to 1759. Children will love the Georgian dressing-up clothes on the top floor, and the temporary exhibits in the attic look at other aspects of 18th-century life. Across Gough Sq is a statue of Johnson’s cat, Hodge, sitting above the full quote explaining why when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life: ‘For there is in London all that life can afford.’"},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371293","id":"371293","name":"Dragon Bar","type":"Night","subtype":"Music","latitude":51.5246723699635,"longitude":-0.0865280628204,"hours":"to 23:00 Sun & Mon, to 00:00 Tue & Wed, to 01:00 Thu, to 02:00 Fri & Sat","address":{"street":"5 Leonard St","locality":"Shoreditch","postcode":"EC2"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7490 7110","text":"tel, info","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7490 7110"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Old St"}],"review":{"summary":"<p>Dragon's been super cool since it opened in the mid-1990s, and has maintained its style thanks to the fact that it's easy to miss: the name is hardly visible and only embossed on an entrance stair.

The present building dates from the early 15th century, making it the only secular stone structure to have survived the Great Fire of 1666, although it was severely damaged both then and during the Blitz of 1940. Most visitors’ first port of call is the impressive <strong>Great Hall</strong>, where you can see the banners and shields of London’s 12 guilds (principal livery companies), which used to wield absolute power throughout the City. The lord mayor and sheriffs are still elected annually in the vast open hall, with its chunky chandeliers and its church-style monuments. It is often closed for various other formal functions, so it’s best to ring ahead. Meetings of the Common Council are held here on the third Thursday of each month (except August) at 1pm, and the Guildhall hosts the awards dinner for the Man Booker Prize, the leading British literary award. Among the monuments to look out for (if the hall is open) are statues of Winston Churchill, Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and the two prime ministers Pitt the Elder and Younger. In the minstrels’ gallery at the western end are statues of the biblical giants Gog and Magog, traditionally considered to be guardians of the City; today’s figures replaced similar 18th-century statues destroyed in the Blitz. The Guildhall’s stained glass was also blown out during the Blitz but a modern window in the southwestern corner depicts the city’s history; look out for a picture of London’s first lord mayor, Richard ‘Dick’ Whittington, and his famous cat. Beneath the Great Hall is London’s largest medieval crypt, with 19 stained-glass windows showing the livery companies’ coats of arms. The crypt can be seen only as part of a free <strong>guided tour</strong>. The buildings to the west house Corporation of London offices and the <strong>Guildhall Library</strong>, founded in about 1420 under the terms of Dick Whittington’s will. It is divided into three sections for research: printed books; manuscripts; and prints, maps and drawings. Also here is the <strong>Clockmakers’ Museum</strong>, which has a collection of more than 700 clocks and watches dating back some 500 years. The clock museum sometimes closes for an hour or two on Monday to wind the clocks."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370689","id":"370689","name":"Guildhall Art Gallery & Roman London Amphitheatre","type":"See","subtype":"Museum","latitude":51.51553345,"longitude":-0.091633618,"hours":"10am-5pm Mon-Sat, noon-4pm Sun","price_string":"adult/senior & student £2.50/1, all day Fri & daily after 3.30pm free","address":{"street":"Guildhall Yard","postcode":"EC2"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7332 3700","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7332 3700"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.guildhall-art-gallery.org.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bank"}],"review":{"summary":"The gallery of the City of London provides a fascinating look at the politics of the Square Mile over the past few centuries, with a great collection of paintings of London in the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the vast frieze entitled <em>The Defeat of the Floating Batteries</em> (1791), depicting the British victory at the Siege of Gibraltar in 1782. This huge painting was removed to safety just a month before the gallery was hit by a German bomb in 1941 – it spent 50 years rolled up before a spectacular restoration in 1999. An even more recent arrival is a sculpture of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, which has to be housed in a protective glass case as the iron lady was decapitated here by an angry punter with a cricket bat soon after its installation in 2002. Today, following some tricky neck surgery, Maggie has finally rejoined the gallery’s collection, but her contentious legacy lives on. The real highlight of the museum is deep in the darkened basement, where the archaeological remains of Roman London’s amphitheatre (coliseum) lie. Discovered only in 1988 when work finally began on a new gallery following the original’s destruction in the Blitz, they were immediately declared an Ancient Monument, and the new gallery was built around them. While only a few remnants of the stone walls lining the eastern entrance still stand, they’re imaginatively fleshed out with a black-and-fluorescent-green trompe l’oeil of the missing seating, and computer-meshed outlines of spectators and gladiators. The roar of the crowd goes up as you reach the end of the entrance tunnel and hit the central stage, giving a real sense of how Roman London might have felt. Markings on the square outside the Guildhall indicate the original extent of the amphitheatre, allowing people to visualise its scale."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371325","id":"371325","name":"Guinea","type":"Night","subtype":"Pub","latitude":51.5112531582845,"longitude":-0.1446676254272,"address":{"street":"30 Bruton Pl","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7409 1728","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7409 1728"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Green Park or Bond St"}],"review":{"summary":"Top-quality Young’s beers, famous autographs on the toilet walls and the whiff of money define this quiet and out-of-the-way pub in London’s most exclusive neighbourhood, Mayfair.

It’s a wonderful place for a ramble, especially to the top of <strong>Parliament Hill</strong>, which offers expansive views across the city and is one of the most popular places in London to fly a kite. Alternatively head up the hill in North Wood or lose yourself in the West Heath. If walking is too pedestrian for you, another major attraction is the bathing ponds (separate beautiful ones for men and women and a slightly less pleasant mixed pond). Sections of the heath area are also laid out for football, cricket and tennis. Those of a more artistic bent should make a beeline for <strong>Kenwood House</strong> but stop to admire the <strong>sculptures</strong> by Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth on the way. If you work up a thirst, there’s no better place to quench it than at the atmospheric – and possibly haunted – <strong>Spaniard’s Inn</strong>, which has a fascinating history and a terrific beer garden. By day and night the West Heath is a gay cruising ground that is so well established that the police often pitch up in the evenings to protect the men who spend their nights here. Continuing the theme, South Green, opposite Hampstead Heath station, is one of Britain’s oldest lavatories, which was built in 1897 and restored in 2000.

Here history is palpable, from the kitchens where you see food being prepared and the grand living quarters of Henry VIII to the spectacular gardens complete with a 300-year-old maze. This is one of the best days out London has to offer and should not be missed by anyone with any interest in British history. Set aside plenty of time to do it justice, bearing in mind that if you come by boat from central London the trip will have already eaten up half the day. Like so many royal residences, Hampton Court Palace was not built for the monarchy at all. In 1515 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of England, built himself a palace in keeping with his sense of self-importance. Unfortunately, even Wolsey couldn’t persuade the pope to grant Henry VIII a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and relations between king and chancellor soured. Against that background, you only need to take one look at the palace to understand why Wolsey felt obliged to present it to Henry, a monarch not too fond of anyone trying to muscle in on his mastery. The hapless Wolsey was charged with high treason but died before he could come to trial, in 1530. As soon as he acquired the palace, Henry set to work expanding it, adding the Great Hall, the exquisite Chapel Royal and the sprawling kitchens. By 1540 this was one of the grandest and most sophisticated palaces in Europe, but Henry only spent an average three weeks a year here. In the late 17th century, William and Mary employed Sir Christopher Wren to build extensions. The result is a beautiful blend of Tudor and ‘restrained baroque’ architecture. Tickets are on sale in the shop to the left as you walk up the path towards the main <strong>Trophy Gate</strong>. Be sure to pick up a leaflet listing the daily program, which will help you plan your visit. This is important as some of the free guided tours require advance booking. Passing through the main gate you arrive first in the <strong>Base Court</strong> and then the <strong>Clock Court</strong>, named after the 16th-century astronomical clock that still shows the sun revolving round the earth. The second court is your starting point; from here you can follow any or all of the six sets of rooms in the complex. Here behind the colonnade you’ll also find the useful <strong>Introductory Exhibition</strong>, explaining what’s where and how the compound functions. The stairs inside Anne Boleyn’s Gatewaylead up to <strong>Henry VIII’s State Apartments</strong>, including the <strong>Great Hall</strong>, the largest single room in the palace, decorated with tapestries and what is considered the country’s best hammer-beam roof. The Horn Room, hung with impressive antlers, leads to the Great Watching Chamber where guards controlled access to the king. Leading off from the chamber is the smaller Pages’ Chamber and the Haunted Gallery. Arrested for adultery and detained in the palace in 1542, Henry’s fifth wife, Catherine Howard, managed to evade her guards and ran screaming down the corridor in search of the king. Her woeful ghost is said to do the same thing to this day. Further along the corridor is the beautiful <strong>Chapel Royal</strong>, built in just nine months and still a place of worship after 450 years. The blue-and-gold vaulted ceiling was originally intended for Christ Church, Oxford, but was installed here instead; the 18th-century reredos was carved by Grinling Gibbons. Also dating from Henry’s day are the delightful <strong>Tudor kitchens</strong>, again accessible from Anne Boleyn’s Gateway and originally able to rustle up meals for a royal household of some 1200 people. The kitchens have been fitted out to look as they might have done in Tudor days and palace ‘servants’ turn the spits, stuff the peacocks and frost the marzipan with real gold leaf. Don’t miss the Great Wine Cellar, which handled the 300 barrels each of ale and wine consumed here annually in the mid-16th century. West of the colonnade in the Clock Court is the entrance to the <strong>Wolsey Rooms</strong> and the <strong>Young Henry VIII Exhibition</strong>. East of the colonnade you’ll find the stairs to the <strong>King’s Apartments</strong>, completed by Wren for William III in 1702. A tour of the apartments takes you up the grand King’s Staircase, painted by Antonio Verrio in about 1700 and flattering the king by comparing him to Alexander the Great. Highlights include the King’s Presence Chamber, dominated by a throne backed with scarlet hangings. The King’s Great Bedchamber, with a bed topped with ostrich plumes, and the King’s Closet (where His Majesty’s toilet has a velvet seat) should not be missed. William’s wife, Mary II, had her own <strong>Queen’s State Apartments</strong>, accessible up the Queen’s Staircase, decorated by William Kent. When Mary died in 1694, work on these was incomplete; they were finished during the reign of George II. The rooms are shown as they might have been when Queen Caroline used them for entertaining between 1716 and 1737. Compared with the King’s Apartments, those for the queen seem austere, although the Queen’s Audience Chamber has a throne as imposing as that of the king. Also worth seeing are the <strong>Georgian Rooms</strong> used by George II and Queen Caroline on the court’s last visit to the palace in 1737. The first rooms were designed to accommodate George’s second son, the Duke of Cumberland, whose bed is woefully tiny for its grand surroundings. In the <strong>Cartoon Gallery</strong>, the real Raphael Cartoons (now in the <strong>Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</strong> ) used to hang; nowadays it’s just the late-17th-century copies. Beyond the Cartoon Gallery are the <strong>Queen’s Private Apartments</strong> : her drawing room and bedchamber, where she and the king would sleep if they wanted to be alone. Particularly interesting are the Queen’s Bathroom, with its tub set on a floor cloth to soak up any spillage, and the Oratory, an attractive room with its exquisite 16th-century Persian carpet. Once you’re finished with the palace interior there are still the gardens to appreciate. Carriage rides for up to five people around the gardens cost £10 and last 20 minutes. Look out for the <strong>Real Tennis Court</strong>, dating from the 1620s and designed for real tennis, a rather different version of the game from that played today. In the restored 24-hectare Riverside Gardens, you’ll find the <strong>Great Vine</strong>. Planted in 1768, it’s still producing just under 320kg of grapes per year; it’s an old vine, no doubt about it, but not the world’s oldest, as they say it is here (that one is in Slovenia). The <strong>Lower Orangery</strong> in the gardens houses Andrea Mantegna’s nine <em>Triumphs of Caesar</em> paintings, bought by Charles I in 1629; the Banqueting House was designed for William III and painted by Antonio Verrio. Look out for the iron screens designed by Jean Tijou. No-one should leave Hampton Court without losing themselves in the famous 800m-long <strong>maze</strong>, made of hornbeam and yew and planted in 1690. The average visitor takes 20 minutes to reach the centre. The maze is included in entry, although those not visiting the palace can enter for £3.50 (£2.50/10 for children/families). Last admission is 5.15pm in summer and 3.45pm in winter. There are trains every half-hour from Waterloo direct to Hampton Court station (30 minutes); it’s a three-minute walk to the palace entrance. The palace can also be reached from Westminster Pier in central London twice daily on riverboats operated by <strong>Westminster Passenger Services Association</strong> from April to October. This is a great trip if the weather is good, but it takes three hours."},"map-visible":false}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370767","id":"370767","name":"Handel House Museum","type":"See","subtype":"Museum","latitude":51.5129825223951,"longitude":-0.145975202322,"hours":"10am-6pm Tue-Sat, to 8pm Thu, noon-6pm Sun","price_string":"adult/child/concession £5/2/4.50","address":{"street":"25 Brook St","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7495 1685","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7495 1685"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.handelhouse.org"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bond St"}],"review":{"summary":"George Frederick Handel lived in this 18th-century Mayfair building for 36 years until his death in 1759, and the house opened as a museum in late 2001.

The museum celebrated the 250th anniversary of Handel’s death with numerous events. Entrance to the museum is on Lancashire Ct.

It is divided into two parts on either side of Swain’s Lane. On the eastern side you can visit the grave of Karl Marx, which is regularly graced with bouquets from the few remaining communist embassies in London. This slightly overgrown and wild part of the cemetery is a very pleasant walk but it’s merely the overflow area. It’s the wonderfully atmospheric western section of this Victorian Valhalla that is the main draw. To visit it, you’ll have to take a tour and deal directly with the brigade of sometimes stroppy silver-haired ladies who run the cemetery. It is a maze of winding paths leading to the Circle of Lebanon, rings of tombs flanking a circular path and topped with a majestic, centuries-old cedar tree. The guides are engaging and gladly point out the various symbols of the age and the eminent dead occupying the tombs, including the scientist Michael Faraday and the dog-show founder Charles Cruft. ‘Dissenters’ (non-Church of Englanders) were buried way off in the woods. <strong>Tours</strong> depart 2pm Monday to Friday except in December to February (book ahead by phone) and every hour 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday (last tour at 3pm December to February, no bookings). Children under the age of eight are not allowed on tours of the West Cemetery. Highgate remains a working cemetery – the most recent well-known addition was Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was done away with under most sinister circumstances in 2006, when the radioactive isotope Polonium 210 somehow made it into his tea in a Mayfair hotel.

It probably helps to be keen on things naval, but the HMS <em>Belfast,</em> spread over five decks and four platforms, is surprisingly interesting for what it shows of the way of life on board a cruiser, from boiler room to living quarters. The operations room has been reconstructed to show its role in the 1943 Battle of North Cape off Norway, which ended in the sinking of the German battleship <em>Scharnhorst</em>.

Charles Barry, assisted by interior designer Augustus Pugin, built it between 1840 and 1860, when the extravagant neo-Gothic style was all the rage. The most famous feature outside the palace is the Clock Tower, commonly known as <strong>Big Ben</strong>. Ben is the bell hanging inside and is named after Benjamin Hall, the commissioner of works when the tower was completed in 1858. If you’re very keen (and a UK resident) you can apply in writing for a free tour of the Clock Tower. Thirteen-tonne Ben has rung in the New Year since 1924, and the clock gets its hands and face washed by abseiling cleaners once every five years. The best view of the whole complex is from the eastern side of Lambeth Bridge. At the opposite end of the building is <strong>Victoria Tower</strong>, completed in 1860. The House of Commons is where Members of Parliament (MPs) meet to propose and discuss new legislation, and to grill the prime minister and other ministers. The huge expenses scandal of 2009 has made those very MPs (or at least those remaining in parliament) more famous than they had ever hoped to be – for all the wrong reasons. The best time to watch a debate is during Prime Minister’s Question Time, for which you will have to book advance tickets through your MP or local British embassy. The layout of the Commons Chamber is based on that of St Stephen’s Chapel in the original Palace of Westminster. The current chamber, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, replaced the earlier one destroyed by a 1941 bomb. Although the Commons is a national assembly of 646 MPs, the chamber has seating for only 437. Government members sit to the right of the Speaker and Opposition members to the left. The Speaker presides over business from a chair given by Australia, while ministers speak from a despatch box donated by New Zealand. When Parliament is in session, visitors are admitted to the <strong>House of Commons Visitors’ Gallery</strong> via <strong>St Stephen’s Entrance</strong>. Expect to queue for an hour or two if you haven’t already organised a ticket. Parliamentary recesses last for three months over the summer and a couple of weeks over Easter and Christmas, so it’s best to ring in advance. To find out what’s being debated on a particular day, check the notice board beside the entrance, or look in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> or the freebie <em>Metro</em> newspaper under ‘Today in Parliament’, though it has to be said that the debates leave a lot to be desired both in terms of attendance and enthusiasm. Bags and cameras must be checked at a cloakroom before you enter the gallery and no large suitcases or backpacks are allowed through the airport-style security gate. After campaign group ‘Fathers 4 Justice’ lobbed a condom full of purple powder at Tony Blair in May 2004 and prohunt campaigners broke into the Commons that September, security was further tightened, and a bulletproof screen now sits between members of the public and the debating chamber. As you’re waiting for your bags to go through the X-ray machines, look left at the stunning roof of <strong>Westminster Hall</strong>, originally built in 1099 and today the oldest surviving part of the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the English monarchy from the 11th to the early 16th centuries. Added between 1394 and 1401, it is the earliest known example of a hammer-beam roof and has been described as ‘the greatest surviving achievement of medieval English carpentry’. Westminster Hall was used for coronation banquets in medieval times, and also served as a courthouse until the 19th century. The trials of William Wallace (1305), Thomas More (1535), Guy Fawkes (1606) and Charles I (1649) all took place here. In the 20th century, monarchs and Winston Churchill lay in state here. The <strong>House of Lords Visitors’ Gallery</strong> is also open for visits. Against a backdrop of peers’ gentle snoring, you can view the intricate Gothic interior that led poor Pugin (1812–52) to an early death from overwork and nervous strain. When Parliament is in recess, there are 75-minute <strong>guided summer tours</strong> of both chambers and other historic buildings. Times change, so telephone or check www.parliament.uk for latest details."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371887","id":"371887","name":"Housmans","type":"Shop","subtype":"Books","latitude":51.531235327874,"longitude":-0.1211500167847,"address":{"street":"5 Caledonian Rd","postcode":"N1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7837 4473","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7837 4473"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.housmans.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"King’s Cross/St Pancras"}],"review":{"summary":"This long-standing radical bookshop, where you’ll find books unavailable on the shelves of the more mainstream stockists, is a good place to keep up to date with all sorts of political and social campaigns, and with your more radical reads.

Spring prompts the gorgeous Rose Gardens, added in 1994, into vivacious bloom, and summers are full of sunbathers, picnickers, frisbee-throwers and general London populace who drape themselves across the green. It is also a magnificent backdrop for open-air concerts, demonstrations and royal occasions. Gun salutes are fired here and soldiers ride through the park each morning on their way to Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall. Hyde Park is separated from Kensington Gardens by the L-shaped Serpentine, a small lake created by the damming of the Westbourne River in the 1730s; it’s a good spot for pleasure boating in summer. Henry VIII expropriated the park from the Church in 1536, after which it became a hunting ground for kings and aristocrats; later it became a popular venue for duels, executions and horse racing. It became the first royal park to open to the public in the early 17th century, and famously hosted the Great Exhibition in 1851. During WWII it became an enormous potato bed. You’ll either love or hate the ornate <strong>Queen Elizabeth Gate</strong> designed by Giuseppe Lund and David Wynne in 1993 to honour the late Queen Mother, which leads onto Park Lane near Hyde Park Corner. West of the gate is the <strong>Holocaust Memorial Garden</strong> (1983), a simple stone marker in a grove of trees with a quote from Lamentations: ‘For thee I weep, streams of tears flow from my eyes because of the destruction of my people.’ North of the gate is the new <strong>7 July Memorial</strong> of 52 square stainless-steel pillars dedicated to the victims of the terrorist bombings in London in July 2005."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093049","id":"1093049","name":"Ian Allan","type":"Shop","subtype":"Books","latitude":51.50112076,"longitude":-0.111465706,"hours":"9am-5.30pm Mon-Fri, to 5pm Sat","address":{"street":"45-46 Lower Marsh","postcode":"SE1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7401 2100","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7401 2100"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.ianallanpublishing.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Waterloo"}],"review":{"summary":"The train-spotter in you won’t be able to resist this shop, which specialises in books on transport and defence: aircraft, motor vehicles, buses and, of course, those choo-choo trains."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093124","id":"1093124","name":"Il Baretto","type":"Eat","subtype":"Italian","latitude":51.51813664,"longitude":-0.154448738,"hours":"closed dinner Sun","price_string":"mains £9-22","price_range":"2","address":{"street":"43 Blandford St","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7486 7340","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7486 7340"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.ilbaretto.co.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bond St"}],"review":{"summary":"Perhaps having ‘bland’ in the address is one of the reasons that this Marylebone location has changed hands between one Italian restaurant and another, but Il Baretto, the latest Italian incarnation, is an unpretentious trattoria that seems to be winning over the locals.

Most of its exhibits are given over to exploring the human and social cost of conflict. Although the museum’s focus is officially on military action involving British or Commonwealth troops during the 20th century, it gives ‘war’ a wide interpretation. So it not only has serious discussion of the two world wars, Korea and Vietnam, but also covers the Cold War, ‘secret’ warfare (ie spying) and even the war on apartheid in South Africa. The core of the six-floor museum is a chronological exhibition on the two world wars on the lower ground floor. In the Trench Experience you walk through the grim day-to-day reality of life on the Somme front line in WWI, and in the more hair-raising Blitz Experience you cower inside a mock bomb shelter during a WWII air raid and then emerge through ravaged East End streets. On the upper floors you find the two most outstanding – and moving – sections: the extensive <strong>Holocaust Exhibition</strong> (not recommended for under 14s) on the 3rd floor, and a stark gallery called <strong>Crimes against Humanity</strong> devoted to genocide in Cambodia, Yugoslavia and Rwanda (not recommended for under 16s). The 2nd floor features war paintings by the likes of Stanley Spencer and John Singer Sargent. <strong>Audioguides</strong> to the permanent collection will cost you £4/3 adult/concession. Temporary exhibits, which charge an admission fee, cover topics ranging from war reporting, camouflage and modern warfare and – our favourite – the role of animals in conflicts from WWI to the present day."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093236","id":"1093236","name":"Inc Bar","type":"Night","subtype":"Cocktail Bar","latitude":51.48178177,"longitude":-0.009279122,"hours":"6pm-1.30am Wed & Thu, 7pm-3am Fri & Sat, 5pm-midnight Sun","address":{"street":"7a College Approach","postcode":"SE10"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8858 6721","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8858 6721"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.incbar.com"],"transports":[],"review":{"summary":"The newest arrival to Greenwich Market and the talk of the village is this bar with a seemingly endless list of cocktails.

Built in 1605, the palace became the favourite royal residence under William and Mary of Orange in 1689, and remained so until George III became king and relocated to Buckingham Palace. Even after that the royal family stayed here occasionally, with Queen Victoria being born here in 1819. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Kensington Palace was variously renovated by Sir Christopher Wren and William Kent. A self-paced audio tour leads you through the surprisingly small, wood-panelled State Apartments dating from William’s time and then the grander apartments by Kent. For most visitors, however, the highlight is the <strong>Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection</strong>, which contains costumes and outfits dating from the 18th century to the present day, including some of Diana’s most impressive frocks. Most beautiful of all the quarters is the <strong>Cupola Room</strong>, where the ceremony initiating men into the exclusive Order of the Garter took place and where Victoria was christened; you can see the order’s crest painted on the trompe l’œil ‘domed’ ceiling, which is actually flat. The <strong>Queen’s Apartments</strong> nearby is where Queen Mary entertained her visitors. The <strong>King’s Gallery</strong>, the largest and longest of the State Apartments displays some of the royal art collection, including the only known painting of a classical subject by Van Dyck. On the ceiling William Kent painted the story of Odysseus but slipped up by giving the Cyclops two eyes. The <strong>King’s Drawing Room</strong> is dominated by a monumentally ugly painting of <strong>Cupid and Venus</strong> by Giorgio Vasari (1511–74), an Italian mannerist painter who used to brag about the speed at which he worked and was better known for his historical record of the Renaissance. There are splendid views of the park and gardens from here; you can also see the <strong>Round Pond</strong>, once full of turtles for turtle soup but now popular for sailing model boats. The <strong>King’s Staircase</strong> is decorated with striking murals by William Kent, who painted himself in a turban on the fake dome. The <strong>Sunken Garden</strong> near the palace is at its prettiest in summer; the nearby <strong>Orangery</strong> designed by Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor as a free-standing conservatory in 1704, is a bright, rather formal, place for tea."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371669","id":"371669","name":"Kensington Place","type":"Eat","subtype":"Modern European","latitude":51.5083251083774,"longitude":-0.1952594518662,"price_string":"2-/3-course set lunch & dinner £16.50/19.50","price_range":"2","address":{"street":"201-209 Kensington Church St","postcode":"W8"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7727 3184","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7727 3184"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.kensingtonplace-restaurant.co.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Notting Hill Gate"}],"review":{"summary":"Trailblazing chef Rowley Leigh has flown the coop, leaving Kensington Place in the hands of the successors to the Conran chain.

Spring is probably the best time to visit, but at any time of year this 120-hectare expanse of lawns, formal gardens and greenhouses has delights to offer. As well as being a public garden, Kew is an important research centre, and it maintains its reputation as the most exhaustive botanical collection in the world. Its wonderful plants and trees aside, Kew has several specific sights within its borders. Assuming you come by tube and enter via Victoria Gate, you’ll come almost immediately to a large pond overlooked by the enormous <strong>Palm House</strong>, a hothouse of metal and curved sheets of glass dating from 1848 and housing all sorts of exotic tropical greenery; the aerial walkway offers a birds’-eye view of the lush vegetation. Just northwest of the Palm House is the tiny but irresistible <strong>Water Lily House</strong>, dating from 1852 and the hottest glasshouse at Kew. Further north is the stunning <strong>Princess of Wales Conservatory</strong>, opened in 1987 and housing plants in 10 different climatic zones – everything from a desert to a mangrove swamp. In the tropical zone you’ll find the most famous of Kew’s 38,000-odd plant species, the 3m-tall <em>titan arum,</em> or ‘corpse flower’, which is overpoweringly obnoxious-smelling when it blooms in April. Just beyond the conservatory is <strong>Kew Gardens Gallery</strong> bordering Kew Green, which houses exhibitions of paintings and photos mostly of a horticultural theme. Heading westwards from the gallery you’ll arrive at the red-brick <strong>Kew Palace</strong>, a former royal residence once known as Dutch House and built in 1631. It was the favourite home of George III and his family; his wife, Queen Charlotte, died here in 1818. The palace underwent extensive renovations for almost a decade and reopened in 2006; don’t miss the Georgian rooms, restored to how they would have looked in 1804, and Princess Elizabeth’s wonderful doll’s house. Other highlights include the <strong>Temperate House</strong>, the world’s largest ornamental glasshouse, and nearby <strong>Evolution House,</strong> tracing plant evolution over 3500 million years; the idyllic <strong>Queen Charlotte’s Cottage</strong> was popular with ‘mad’ George III and his wife. Don’t forget to see the <strong>Japanese Gateway</strong> and the celebrated 10-storey <strong>Pagoda</strong> (1761), designed by William Chambers. Just north is the <strong>Marianne North Gallery</strong> featuring paintings on a botanical theme. Marianne North was one of those indomitable Victorian female travellers who roamed the continents from 1871 to 1885, painting plants and trees along the way. The results of her labour now cover the walls of this small purpose-built gallery. The <strong>Orangery</strong> near Kew Palace contains a restaurant, cafe and shop. If you want a good overview of the gardens, jump aboard the <strong>Kew Explorer minitrain</strong>, which allows you to hop on and off at stops along the way. The full circuit takes about 40 minutes. You can get to Kew Gardens by tube or train. Come out of the station and walk straight (west) along Station Ave, cross Kew Gardens Rd and then continue straight along Lichfield Rd. This will bring you to Victoria Gate. Alternatively, from April to October, boats run by the <strong>Westminster Passenger Services Association</strong> sail from Westminster Pier to Kew Gardens up to four times a day. There is now a Rhizotron and Xstrata Treetop Walkway which takes you underground and then 18 metres up in the air, for an alternative and new view of tree anatomy."},"map-visible":false}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093193","id":"1093193","name":"Kew Greenhouse","type":"Eat","subtype":"Cafe","latitude":51.4771666208344,"longitude":-0.2865564823151,"hours":"8.30am-6.30pm","price_string":"mains £7-10","price_range":"1","address":{"street":"1 Station Pde","postcode":"TW9"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8940 0183","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8940 0183"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Kew Gardens"}],"review":{"summary":"This delightful botanically themed cafe will help set the mood for a visit to nearby <strong>Kew Gardens</strong>.

Lloyd’s is the work of Richard Rogers, one of the architects of the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and although it was a watershed for London when it was built in 1986, it’s since been overtaken by plenty of other stunning architecture throughout the capital and looks rather tiny next to the giant Gherkin across the road.

This is where the word ‘zoo’ originated and after a patchy period in the 1990s, London Zoo has become one of the most progressive in the world. It is in the process of implementing a long-term modernisation plan and the emphasis is now firmly placed on conservation, education and breeding, with fewer species and more spacious conditions. The newest developments have brought <strong>Gorilla Kingdom</strong>, a project that involves a gorilla conservation program in Gabon with the aim of providing habitat for Western gorillas and protecting them by providing the local communities and former poachers with work in the program. The zoo has three gorillas – Zaire, Effie and Mjukuu – who live on their own island; their space measures 1600 sq metres. The <strong>Clore Rainforest Lookout and Nightzone</strong> is another excellent installation – a slice of the South American rainforest complete with marmosets, monkeys, fruit bats and other creatures wandering and flying freely among the visitors inside the humid, tropical-climate room. The monkeys are especially happy to roam – they see it as their territory, so watch out! The elegant and cheerful <strong>Penguin Pool</strong>, designed by Berthold Lubetkin in 1934, is one of London’s foremost modernist structures, although the penguins didn’t like it and are now bathing at a more ordinary round pool. Other highlights include <strong>Butterfly Paradise</strong>, <strong>Into Africa</strong> and <strong>Meet the Monkeys</strong>. In 2008 the Mappin Terrace (which was formerly home to London Zoo’s polar bears) reopened as the <strong>Outback</strong> exhibit, a slice of Australia, home to wallabies and emus, and focusing on the challenges that climate change will present to animals living in already hot climates. A great way to visit the zoo is by canal boat from Little Venice or Camden, but you can also reach it by walking along the canal towpath. There’s a delightful <strong>children’s zoo</strong>, which is built almost entirely from sustainable materials, and busy programs of events and attractions (such as elephant bathing and penguin feeding) throughout the year."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371991","id":"371991","name":"Long Acre","type":"Shop","subtype":"Shopping Centre","latitude":51.5118140403244,"longitude":-0.1267451047897,"address":{"street":"Long Acre","locality":"Soho","extras":"Covent Garden"},"telephones":[],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Covent Garden"}],"review":{"summary":"<p>Full of affordable High-Street chains, including Warehouse, Reiss and Zara.

It’s unbelievably kitsch and terribly overpriced, yet it draws more than three million people every year and sits high on the ‘must-do’ list of any visitor to London. Different strokes for different folks, as they say, but if you like the idea of wax celebrities, movie stars and fantastically lifelike figures of the Windsors, you’re in for a treat. Madame Tussauds dates back more than two centuries when the eponymous Swiss model-maker started making death masks of the people killed during the French Revolution. She came to London in 1803 and exhibited around 30 wax models in Baker St, on a site not far from this building, which has housed the waxworks since 1885. The models were an enormous hit in Victorian times, when they provided visitors with their only glimpse of the famous and infamous before photography was widespread and long before the advent of TV. Madame Tussauds is very keen on public surveys telling it who the punters would like to see most, resulting in such highlights as a photo op with the <strong>Kate Moss</strong> figure (a poor likeness), an eco <strong>Prince Charles</strong> statue, the <strong>Blush Room</strong> where A-listers stand listlessly and where the J-Lo figure blushes if you whisper in her ear. <strong>Bollywood</strong> fans are treated with a smiling Shahrukh Khan and <strong>‘Big Bruvva’</strong> lovers can get into the Diary Room and take the video home. The latest addition to the collection is of <strong>London Mayor Boris Johnson</strong>, smiling cheekily at the visitors, and the website features a YouTube video of the live Boris Johnson next to his waxen doppelganger, telling a bunch of journalists that Madame Tussauds is ‘one of those London attractions that will pull this city out of the recession’. All for a good cause, then. Permanent photo opportunities include the political leaders in <strong>World Stage</strong> and the array of celebrities in <strong>Premiere Room</strong>. The famous <strong>Chamber of Horrors</strong> details the gory exploits of Jack the Ripper and is usually a huge hit with children. Finally you can take a ride in the <strong>Spirit of London ‘time taxi’</strong>, where you sit in a mock-up of a London black cab and are whipped through a five-minute historical summary of London, a mercifully short time to endure the god-awful scripts and hackneyed commentary. The old Planetarium is now the <strong>Stardome</strong>, which screens an entertaining and educational animation by Nick Park, creator of <em>Wallace and Gromit</em> (it involves aliens and celebrities). In case you were wondering what happens to the models of those people whose 15 minutes have passed, contrary to popular belief, they are never melted down, but simply rest in storage. If you want to avoid the queues (particularly in summer) book your tickets online and get a timed entry slot. They are cheaper this way too."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093131","id":"1093131","name":"Magdalen","type":"Eat","subtype":"Modern British","latitude":51.50368262,"longitude":-0.081140888,"hours":"closed lunch Sat & all day Sun","price_string":"mains £13.50-17, 2-/3-course set lunch £15.50/18.50","price_range":"2","address":{"street":"152 Tooley St","postcode":"SE1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7403 1342","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7403 1342"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.magdalenrestaurant.co.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"London Bridge"}],"review":{"summary":"This stylish dining room on two levels seems somewhat out of place in hard-core Tooley St but any port in a storm will do in these parts.

That’s not surprising when you consider that it’s encased in concrete and located above a roundabout in the Barbican. Despite this, once you’re inside it’s a fascinating walk through the various incarnations of the capital from Anglo-Saxon village to global financial centre. At the time of writing the lower floor of the museum, covering the period 1666 to the present day, was shut for a total revamp, but it was due to reopen in early 2010. The first gallery here, London Before London, outlines the development of the Thames Valley from 450 million years ago. Harnessing computer technology to enliven its exhibits and presenting impressive fossils and stone axe heads in shiny new cases, it does a good job of bringing to life the ancient settlements that pre-dated the capital. Next up is the city’s Roman era, a far more interactive experience, full of interesting displays and models of how the city would have looked at the height of Roman influence. The rest of the floor takes you through the Saxon, medieval, Tudor and Stuart periods, culminating in the Great Fire of 1666. You can pause for a breather in the pleasant garden in the building’s central courtyard or head for the adjoining <strong>Museum Café</strong>, which serves light meals from 10am to 5.30pm (from 11.30am on Sunday). Alternatively, on a sunny day, pack some sandwiches and lunch in the next-door <strong>Barber Surgeon’s Herb Garden</strong>.

But it’s the quality of the works, and not the quantity, that impresses most. Almost five million people visit each year, keen to see seminal paintings from every important epoch in the history of art, including works by Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, Velázquez, Van Gogh and Renoir, just to name a few. Although it can get ridiculously busy in here, the galleries are spacious, sometimes even sedate, and it’s never so bad that you can’t appreciate the works. That said, weekday mornings and Wednesday evenings (after 6pm) are the best times to visit, as the crowds are small. If you have the time to make multiple visits, focus on one section at a time to fully appreciate the astonishing collection. The size and layout can be confusing, so make sure you pick up a free gallery plan at the entrance. To see the art in chronological order, start with the Sainsbury Wing on the gallery’s western side, which houses paintings from 1260 to 1510. In these 16 rooms you can explore the Renaissance through paintings by Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Raphael and Titian, among others. This is where you’ll also find the Micro gallery, a dozen computer terminals on which you can explore the pictorial database, find the location of your favourite works or create your own personalised tour. The High Renaissance (1510–1600) is covered in the West Wing, where Michelangelo, Titian, Correggio, El Greco and Bronzino hold court, while Rubens, Rembrandt and Caravaggio can be found in the North Wing (1600–1700). The most crowded part of the gallery – and for good reason – is likely to be the East Wing (1700–1900) and particularly the many works of the impressionists and postimpressionists, including Van Gogh, Gauguin, Cézanne, Monet, Degas and Renoir. Although it hardly stands out in such exalted company, the impressive display featuring 18th-century British landscape artists Gainsborough, Constable and Turner is also well worth checking out. The gallery’s collection cuts off at 1900; to see 20th-century art you need to head to <strong>Tate Modern</strong> and, for British art, <strong>Tate Britain</strong>. Temporary exhibitions – for which you nor­mally have to pay, and often book in advance – go on show in the basement of the Sainsbury Wing and are often outstanding. If you want to immerse yourself in this pool of riches rather than just skim across the surface, borrow a themed or comprehensive audioguide (£3.50 donation recommended) from the Central Hall. Free one-hour introductory <strong>guided tours</strong> leave from the information desk in the Sainsbury Wing daily at 11.30am and 2.30pm, with an extra tour at 6.30pm on Wednesday. There are also special trails and activity sheets for children. The new <strong>National Dining Rooms</strong>, in the Sainsbury Wing, is a wonderful recent addition to the gallery. Run by Oliver Peyton (the man behind Inn the Park in St James’s Park), this is an excellent, well-lit space, with quality British food in the restaurant, and pastries and cakes in the bakery."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370939","id":"370939","name":"National Maritime Museum","type":"See","subtype":"Museum","latitude":51.4810257,"longitude":-0.005480822,"hours":"10am-5pm","price_string":"admission free, charges vary for special exhibitions","address":{"street":"Romney Rd","postcode":"SE10"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8312 6565","text":"recorded information","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8312 6565"},{"area_code":"020","number":"8858 4422","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8858 4422"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.nmm.ac.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"train","description":"Greenwich or DLR Cutty Sark"}],"review":{"summary":"Though it hardly sounds like a crowd-pleaser, this museum designed to tell the long and convoluted history of Britain as a seafaring nation is the best attraction in Greenwich.

The exhibits are arranged by theme, focusing on Explorers, Maritime London, Art and Sea and so on. Visual highlights include the 19m-long golden state barge built in 1732 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the huge ship’s propeller installed on level 1. The museum also owns the uniform coat that Britain’s greatest sea-faring hero, Horatio Nelson, was wearing when he was fatally shot (including the actual bullet), plus a replica of the lifeboat <em>James Caird</em> used by explorer Ernest Shackleton and a handful of his men after the <em>Endurance</em> sank on their epic mission in Antarctica. The restored stained glass from the Baltic Exchange, blown up by the IRA in 1992, is now a memorial to the victims of WWI.

Despite the recent discovery that the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Flower portrait of the Bard was a 19th-century forgery, the National Portrait Gallery still believes this one to have been painted during Shakespeare’s lifetime. To follow the paintings chronologically you should take the huge escalator to the top floor and work your way down. The 1st floor is dedicated to the Royal Family, but the most fun is seeing one of the two portraits of the Queen made by Andy Warhol. The ground floor is most interesting with portraits of contemporary figures using a variety of media, including sculpture and photography. Among the most popular of these is Sam Taylor-Wood’s <em>David,</em> a video-portrait of David Beckham asleep after football training, which caused a lot of women to suddenly take an interest in this part of the gallery. There’s an annual Photographic Portrait Prize exhibition, featuring some of the best contemporary photographers. Audioguides (a £3.50 donation is suggested) highlight some 200 portraits and allow you to hear the voices of some of the people portrayed. The Portrait Café and bookshop are in the basement and the <strong>Portrait</strong> restaurant is on the top floor, offering some superb views towards Westminster."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370901","id":"370901","name":"National Theatre","type":"See","subtype":"Theatre","latitude":51.50709152,"longitude":-0.113708511,"hours":"10:00-23:00, closed Bank holidays","price_string":"admission Olivier & Lyttleton £10-£36, Cottesloe £10-£28","address":{"street":"South Bank","postcode":"SE1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7452 3000","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7452 3000"}],"emails":["info@nationaltheatre.org.uk"],"urls":["www.nationaltheatre.org.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Waterloo"}],"review":{"summary":"This is the nation’s flagship theatre complex, comprising three auditoriums: the Olivier, the Lyttelton and the Cottesloe.

Walking into the <strong>Life galleries</strong> (Blue Zone) in the 1880 Gothic Revival building off Cromwell Rd evokes the musty moth-eaten era of the Victorian gentleman scientist. The main museum building, with its blue and sand-coloured brick and terracotta, was designed by Alfred Waterhouse and is as impressive as the towering <strong>diplodocus dinosaur skeleton</strong> in the Central Hall just ahead of the main entrance. It’s hard to match any of the exhibits with this initial sight, except perhaps the huge <strong>blue whale</strong> just beyond it. Children, who are the main fans of this museum, are primed for more primeval wildlife by the dinosaur skeleton, and yank their parents to the <strong>dinosaur gallery</strong> to the left of the Central Hall to see the roaring and tail-flicking animatronics T-rex dinosaur, the museum’s star attraction. The Life galleries to the right of the Central Hall (Green Zone) are full of fossils and glass cases of taxidermied birds, and the antiquated atmosphere is mesmerising. There is also a stunning <strong>Creepy Crawlies</strong> room, the Ecology gallery’s <strong>video wall</strong> and the vast <strong>Darwin Centre</strong> (Orange Zone) which focuses on taxonomy (the study of the natural world), with some 450, 000 jars of pickled specimens, including an 8.6m-long giant squid called Archie, shown off during free guided tours every half-hour (book in advance). The centre’s new feature showcases some 28 million insects and six million plants in ‘a giant cocoon’. The second part of the museum, the <strong>Earth galleries</strong> (Red Zone) can be reached most easily from the Exhibition Rd entrance. Here Victorian fustiness is exchanged for sleek, modern design and the black walls of its <strong>Earth Hall</strong> are lined with crystals, gems and precious rocks. An escalator slithers up through a hollowed-out globe into displays about earth’s geological make-up. Volcanoes, earthquakes and storms are all featured on the upper floors, but the star attraction inside the <strong>Restless Surface gallery</strong>, is the <strong>mock-up of the Kobe earthquake</strong>, a facsimile of a small Japanese grocery shop that trembles in a manner meant to replicate the 1995 earthquake that killed 6000 people. Exhibitions on the lower floors focus on ecology, look at gems and other precious stones and explore how planets are formed. The <strong>Wildlife Garden</strong> (open April to September) displays a range of British lowland habitats. A stunning temporary exhibit that may become permanent is the <strong>Butterfly Jungle</strong>, a tunnel tent on the East Lawn swarming with what must originally have been called ‘flutter-bys’."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093125","id":"1093125","name":"Natural Kitchen","type":"Eat","subtype":"Organic","latitude":51.51925497,"longitude":-0.152008988,"price_string":"mains £8-10","price_range":"1","address":{"street":"77-78 Marylebone High St","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7486 8065","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7486 8065"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bond St"}],"review":{"summary":"This is a decent, practical place to drop in for a relaxing pit stop in between raiding the shops on Marylebone High Street.

A box of sawdust was placed beneath the table to catch the blood and guts and contemporary accounts record the surgeons wearing frock coats ‘stiff and stinking with pus and blood’.

Today it also frames Canary Wharf and the skyscrapers of Docklands to the north. Built on the site of the Old Palace of Placentia, where Henry VIII was born in 1491, the hospital was initially intended for those wounded in the victory over the French at La Hogue. In 1869 the building was converted to a Naval College. Now even the navy has left and the premises are home to the University of Greenwich and Trinity College of Music. Two main rooms are open to the public. In the King William Building, the <strong>Painted Hall</strong> is one of Europe’s greatest banquet rooms and is covered in decorative ‘allegorical Baroque’ murals by artist James Thornhill, who also painted the cupola of St Paul’s Cathedral. The mural above the Lower Hall show William and Mary enthroned amid symbols of the Virtues. Beneath William’s feet you can see the defeated French king Louis XIV grovelling with a furled flag in hand. Up a few steps is the Upper Hall where, on the western wall, George I is depicted with his family. In the bottom right-hand corner Thornhill drew himself into the picture, pointing towards his work. Off the Upper Hall is the <strong>Nelson Room</strong>, originally designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, then used as a smoking room and now open to the public. In January 1806 the brandy-soaked (for embalming purposes, of course) body of the great naval hero lay in state here before his funeral at St Paul’s. Today the room contains a plaster replica of the statue atop Nelson’s column in Trafalgar Sq plus other memorabilia, including lots of hospital silver. Look to the courtyard through the window; the cobbles form an outline of the Union Flag (Union Jack). A 90-minute <strong>guided tour</strong> from the Painted Hall will take you to places not normally open to the public: the Jacobean undercroft of the former Placentia palace and the 140-year-old Victorian Skittle Alley, featuring enormous hand-carved wooden bowling balls and pins. The <strong>chapel</strong> in the Queen Mary Building opposite the Painted Hall is decorated in a lighter rococo style. The eastern end of the chapel is dominated by a painting by the 18th-century American artist Benjamin West showing <em>The Preservation of St Paul after Shipwreck at Malta</em>. It’s certainly a beautiful room, but is more famous for its organ and acoustics. If possible come on the first Sunday of the month, when there’s a free 50-minute <strong>organ recital</strong> at 3pm, or time your visit for sung Eucharist at 11am on Sunday."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371393","id":"371393","name":"Old Ship","type":"Night","subtype":"Pub","latitude":51.4903153008602,"longitude":-0.239714384079,"address":{"street":"25 Upper Mall","postcode":"W6"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8748 2593","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8748 2593"}],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Hammersmith or Ravenscourt Park"}],"review":{"summary":"This restful towpath pub is the prime stop-off for families and couples on their walks by the Thames.

And despite the stifling crowds and racing midday traffic, the flashing ads and buzzing liveliness of Piccadilly Circus always make it exciting to be in London. The circus looks its best at night, when the flashing advertisement panels really shine against the dark sky. Designed by John Nash in the 1820s, the hub was named after the street Piccadilly, which earned its name in the 17th century from the stiff collars (picadils) that were the sartorial staple of the time (and were the making of a nearby tailor’s fortune). At the centre of the circus is the famous lead statue, the Angel of Christian Charity, dedicated to the philanthropist and child-labour abolitionist Lord Shaftesbury, and derided when unveiled in 1893, sending the sculptor into early retirement. The sculpture was at first cast in gold, but it was later replaced by the present-day one. Down the years the angel has been mistaken for <strong>Eros</strong>, the God of Love, and the misnomer has stuck (you’ll even see signs for ‘Eros’ from the Underground). It’s a handy meeting place for tourists, though if you don’t like the crowds, meet at the charging <strong>Horses of Helios</strong> statue at the edge of Piccadilly and Haymarket – apparently a much cooler place to convene. John Nash had originally designed Regent St and Piccadilly to be the two most elegant streets in town but, curbed by city planners, Nash couldn’t realise his dream to the full. In the many years since his noble plans, Piccadilly Circus has become swamped with tourists, with streets such as Coventry St flogging astronomically priced cheap tat to unsuspecting visitors. Coventry St leads to Leicester Sq, while Shaftesbury Ave takes you to the heart of the West End’s theatreland. Piccadilly itself leads to the sanctuary of Green Park. On Haymarket, check out New Zealand House (built in 1959 on the site of the Carlton Hotel, which was bombed during the war), where the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh (1890–1969) worked as a waiter in 1913. Have a look down Lower Regent St for a glimpse of glorious Westminster. Just east of the circus is <strong>London Trocadero</strong>, a huge and soulless indoor amusement arcade that has six levels of hi-tech, high-cost fun for youngsters, along with cinemas, US-themed restaurants and bowling alleys."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093126","id":"1093126","name":"Ping Pong","type":"Eat","latitude":51.52087527,"longitude":-0.152520206,"price_string":"dim sum from £3, set lunches £10-13","address":{"street":"10 Paddington St","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7009 9600","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7009 9600"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.pingpongdimsum.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Baker St"}],"review":{"summary":"Marylebone branch of a trendy six-outlet chain that is a popular lunch and after-work dinner destination."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370889","id":"370889","name":"Pizza Express Jazz Club","type":"Night","subtype":"Jazz/Blues","latitude":51.5151391277353,"longitude":-0.1333701610565,"address":{"street":"10 Dean St","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7439 8722","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7439 8722"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.pizzaexpress.co.uk/jazz.htm"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Tottenham Court Rd"}],"review":{"summary":"Believe it or not, this is one of the most consistently popular and good jazz venues in London.

Like many of the city’s parks, this one was used as a royal hunting ground, and then as farmland, before it was used as a place for fun and leisure during the 18th century. These days it’s a well-organised but relaxed, lively but serene, local but cosmopolitan haven in the heart of the city. Among its many attractions are the London Zoo, the Grand Union Canal along its northern side, an ornamental lake, an open-air theatre in Queen Mary’s Gardens where Shakespeare is performed during the summer months, ponds and colourful flowerbeds, rose gardens that look spectacular in June, football pitches and summer games of softball.

Be advised that it is slated to undergo a massive modernisation costing £150 million. Parts or all of the museum may be closed when you visit so call or check the website beforehand. The <strong>Energy Hall</strong>, on the ground floor as you enter, concentrates on full-sized machines of the Industrial Revolution, showing how the first steam engines such as Puffing Billy, a steam locomotive dating from 1813, helped Britain become ‘the workshop of the world’ in the early 19th century. Animations show how the machines worked and are accompanied by detailed overall explanations, including a section on the Luddites who opposed the march of technology. Of course, it’s impossible to miss the <strong>Energy Ring</strong>, a huge interactive sculpture that hangs in the space next to the gallery called <strong>Energy: Fuelling the Future</strong> on the 2nd floor. Kids can enter their names then ask energy questions: the answers appear like electronic tickertape messages, running around the inside of the ring. On the same level you will also find a re-creation of <strong>Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine</strong> (1834), now considered the forerunner to the computer. The 3rd-floor <strong>Flight</strong> and <strong>Launchpad galleries</strong> are favourite places for children, with its gliders, hot-air balloon and varied aircraft, including the <em>Gipsy Moth,</em> in which Amy Johnson flew to Australia in 1930. This floor also features an adapted <strong>flight simulator</strong> that’s been turned into a ‘Motionride’ (admission fees apply). The 1st floor has displays on food and time, while the 4th and 5th floors offer exhibits on medical and veterinary history. Nostalgic parents will delight in the old cars and the <strong>Apollo 10 command module</strong> in the <strong>Making the Modern World gallery</strong> on the ground floor. However, both they and their children will probably most enjoy the hi-tech <strong>Wellcome Wing</strong>, which is spread over several floors at the back of the building. <strong>IMAX Cinema</strong> here shows the usual crop of travelogues, space adventures and dinosaur attacks in stunning 3-D.

The building is a wooden O without a roof over the central stage area, and although there are covered wooden bench seats in tiers around the stage, many people (there’s room for 700) like to do as the 17th-century ‘groundlings’ did, and stand in front of the stage, shouting and heckling. Because the building is quite open to the elements, you may have to wrap up. No umbrellas are allowed, but cheap rain coats are on sale. The theatre season runs from late April to mid-October and includes works by Shakespeare and his contemporaries such as Christopher Marlowe. The theatre’s artistic director, Dominic Dromgoole, has decided to introduce a couple of new plays each season and we can’t help but think that Will would have liked it that way.

The building is the beautiful, bewitching home of architect Sir John Soane (1753–1837), which he left brimming with surprising personal effects and curiosities, and the museum represents his exquisite and eccentric taste. Soane was a country bricklayer’s son, most famous for designing the Bank of England. In his work and life, he drew on ideas picked up while on an 18th-century grand tour of Italy. He married a rich woman and used the wealth to build this house and the one next door, which was opened as an exhibition and education space in late 2007. The heritage-listed house is largely as it was when Sir John was carted out in a box, and is itself a main part of the attraction. It has a glass dome that brings light right down to the basement, a lantern room filled with statuary, rooms within rooms, and a picture gallery where paintings are stowed behind each other on folding wooden panes. You can see Soane’s choice paintings, including Canalettos and Turners, drawings by Christopher Wren and Robert Adam, and the original <em>Rake’s Progress,</em> William Hogarth’s set of cartoon caricatures of late-18th-century London lowlife. You’ll have to ask a guard to open the panes so that you can view all the paintings. Among Soane’s more unusual acquisitions are an Egyptian hieroglyphic sarcophagus, an imitation monk’s parlour, and slaves’ chains. Note that groups of seven or more need to book ahead and are not admitted on Saturday, which is by far the museum’s busiest day. Evenings of the first Tuesday of each month are a choice time to visit as the house is lit by candles and the atmosphere is even more magical."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/1093009","id":"1093009","name":"Sister Ray","type":"Shop","latitude":51.51462887,"longitude":-0.13561149,"address":{"street":"34-35 Berwick St","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7734 3297","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7734 3297"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.sisterray.co.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Oxford Circus"}],"review":{"summary":"If you were a fan of the late, great John Peel on the BBC/BBC World Service, this specialist in innovative, experimental and indie music is just right for you."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371623","id":"371623","name":"Six 13","type":"Eat","subtype":"Jewish","latitude":51.5164410536692,"longitude":-0.147145986557,"hours":"lunch Mon-Fri, dinner Mon-Thu","price_string":"mains from £15.50","price_range":"2","address":{"street":"Bond St","locality":"Marylebone"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7629 6133","text":"tel, info","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7629 6133"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.six13.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bond St"}],"review":{"summary":"<p>Central London's poshest kosher restaurant, Six 13 (the name comes from the 613 <i>mitzvots,</i> or commandments, that are binding on religious Jews) is certified glatt by the Sephardic Kashrut Authority of the UK.

It dates from the early 16th century and was heavily restored 300 years later. During the Crusades, the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, soldiers who took on a nursing role, established a priory in Clerkenwell that originally covered around 4 hectares. The gate was built in 1504 as a grand entrance to their church, St John’s Clerkenwell in St John’s Sq. Although most of the buildings were destroyed when Henry VIII dissolved every priory in the country between 1536 and 1540, the gate lived on. It had a varied afterlife, not least as a Latin-speaking coffee house run, without much success, by William Hogarth’s father during Queen Anne’s reign. The restoration dates from the period when it housed the Old Jerusalem Tavern in the 19th century. A pub of (almost) that name can now be found round the corner on Britton St. Inside St John’s Gate is the small <strong>Order of St John Museum</strong>, which was closed for a full refit at the time of writing and should reopen in 2010. Definitely try to time your visit for one of the <strong>guided tours</strong> of the gate and the restored church remains, though. This includes the fine Norman crypt with a sturdy alabaster monument commemorating a Castilian knight (1575); a battered monument portraying the last prior, William Weston, as a skeleton in a shroud; and stained-glass windows showing the main figures in the story.

The proud bearer of the capital’s largest church dome, St Paul’s Cathedral has seen a lot in its 300-plus years, although Ludgate Hill has been a place of worship for almost 1400 years, the current incarnation being the fifth to stand on this site. St Paul’s almost didn’t make it off the drawing board, as Wren’s initial designs were rejected. However, since its first service in 1697, it’s held funerals for Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Winston Churchill, and has played host to Martin Luther King as well as the ill-fated wedding of Charles and Diana. For Londoners the vast dome, which still manages to loom amid the far higher skyscrapers in the Square Mile, is a symbol of resilience and pride – miraculously surviving the Blitz unscathed. Having undergone a huge restoration project to coincide with its 300th anniversary in 2010, the cathedral is today looking better than it has done for decades, though parts of its facade were still covered in scaffolding at the time of writing. Despite all the fascinating history and its impressive interior, people are usually most interested in climbing the <strong>dome</strong> for one of the best views of London imaginable. It actually consists of three domes, one inside the other, but it made the cathedral Wren’s <em>tour de force</em> and only a handful of others throughout the world (mostly in Italy) outdo it in size. Exactly 530 stairs take you to the top, but it’s a three-stage journey. The cathedral is built in the shape of a cross, with the dome at its intersection. So first find the circular paved area between the eight massive columns supporting the dome, then head to the door on the western side of the southern transept. Some 30m and precisely 259 steps above, you reach the interior walkway around the dome’s base. This is the <strong>Whispering Gallery</strong>, so called because if you talk close to the wall it really does carry your words around to the opposite side, 32m away. Climbing even more steps (another 119) you reach the <strong>Stone Gallery</strong>, which is an exterior viewing platform, with 360-degree views of London, all of which are rather obscured by pillars and other suicide-preventing measures. The further 152 iron steps to the <strong>Golden Gallery</strong> are steeper and narrower than below but are really worth the effort as long as you don’t suffer from claustrophobia. From here, 111m above London, the city opens up to you, the view unspoilt by superfluous railings; you’ll be hard pushed to see anything better. Of course, back on the ground floor, St Paul’s offers plenty of riches for those who like to keep their feet firmly on its black-and-white tiled floor – and the interior has been stunningly restored in recent years. Just beneath the dome, for starters, is a compass and an <strong>epitaph</strong> written for Wren by his son: <em>Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice</em> (Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you). In the northern aisle you’ll find the <strong>All Souls’ Chapel</strong> and the <strong>Chapel of St Dunstan</strong>, dedicated to the 10th-century archbishop of Canterbury, and the grandiose <strong>Duke of Wellington Memorial</strong> (1875). In the north transept chapel is Holman Hunt’s celebrated painting <strong>The Light of the World</strong><em>,</em> which depicts Christ knocking at an overgrown door that, symbolically, can only be opened from the inside. Beyond, in the cathedral’s heart, are the particularly spectacular <strong>quire</strong> (or chancel) – its ceilings and arches dazzling with green, blue, red and gold mosaics – and the <strong>high altar</strong>. The ornately carved <strong>choir stalls</strong> by Grinling Gibbons on either side of the quire are exquisite, as are the ornamental <strong>wrought-iron gates</strong>, separating the aisles from the altar, by Jean Tijou (both men also worked on Hampton Court Palace). Walk around the altar, with its massive gilded oak canopy, to the <strong>American Memorial Chapel</strong>, a memorial to the 28, 000 Americans based in Britain who lost their lives during WWII. Around the southern side of the ambulatory is the <strong>effigy of John Donne</strong> (1573–1631). The one-time dean of St Paul’s, Donne was also a metaphysical poet, most famous for the immortal lines ‘No man is an island’ and ‘Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee’ (both in the same poem!). On the eastern side of both the north and south transepts are stairs leading down to the <strong>crypt</strong>, treasury and <strong>OBE Chapel</strong>, where weddings, funerals and other services are held for members of the Order of the British Empire. The crypt has memorials to some 300 military demigods, including Florence Nightingale and Lord Kitchener, while both the <strong>Duke of Wellington</strong> and <strong>Admiral Nelson</strong> are actually buried here, Nelson having been placed in a black sarcophagus that is directly under the centre of the dome. On the surrounding walls are plaques in memory of those from the Commonwealth who died in various conflicts during the 20th century. <strong>Wren’s tomb</strong> is in the crypt, while architect Edwin Lutyens, painter Joshua Reynolds and poet William Blake are also remembered here. In a niche, there is also an exhibition of Wren’s controversial plans for St Paul’s and his actual working model. St Paul’s was one of the 50 commissions the great architect was given after the Great Fire of London wiped out most of the City. The <strong>treasury</strong> hosts temporary exhibitions and is not always open, but it’s worth a look when it is, depending on what’s on. Elsewhere in the crypt is the <strong>Crypt Café</strong> and the restaurant <strong>Refectory</strong>, in addition to a <strong>shop</strong>. Just outside the north transept, there’s a simple <strong>monument to the people of London</strong>, honouring the 32, 000 civilians killed (and another 50, 000 seriously injured) in the City during WWII. Also to the left as you face the entrance stairway is <strong>Temple Bar</strong>, one of the original gateways to the City of London. This medieval stone archway once straddled Fleet St at a site marked by a <strong>griffin</strong> but was removed to Middlesex in 1878. Temple Bar was restored and made a triumphal return to London (albeit in a totally new place) alongside the redevelopment of Paternoster Sq in 2003. <strong>Audioguide tours</strong> in multiple languages last 45 minutes; <strong>guided tours</strong> lasting 1½ to two hours leave the tour desk at 10.45am, 11.15am, 1.30pm and 2pm.

The venerable Tate Britain, built in 1897, stretched out splendidly to fill the increased space with its definitive collection of British art from the 16th to the late 20th centuries, while the Modern sister devoted its space to, well, modern art. The permanent galleries are broadly chronological in order, and you can expect to see some of the most important works by artists such as Constable and Gainsborough – who have entire galleries devoted to them – and Hogarth, Reynolds, Stubbs, Blake and Henry Moore, among others. Adjoining the main building is the Clore Gallery, which houses the superb JMW Turner, including the two recovered classics <em>Shade and Darkness</em> and <em>Light and Colour,</em> which were nicked in 1994 and found nine years later. Just as you are thinking that all the moderns and contemporaries were up at the Modern, Tate Britain’s got work by Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, David Hockney and Howard Hodgkin, as well as Anthony Gormley and bad-girl Tracey Emin. Tate Britain also hosts the prestigious and often controversial Turner Prize for contemporary art from October to early December every year. There are several free one-hour <strong>thematic tours</strong> each day, mostly on the hour (last tour at 3pm), along with free 15-minute talks on paintings, painters and styles at 1.15pm Tuesday to Thursday in the Rotunda. <strong>Audio-guide tours</strong> for the collection are available. A good time to visit the gallery is Late at Tate night, on the first Friday of every month, when the gallery stays open until 10pm. The best way to see both Tates and have a fabulous art day is to catch the boat that connects the two galleries."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/370395","id":"370395","name":"Tate Modern","type":"See","subtype":"Art Gallery","latitude":51.5075137682097,"longitude":-0.0991129875183,"hours":"10am-6pm Sun-Thu, to 10pm Fri & Sat","price_string":"admission free, special exhibitions £8-10","address":{"street":"Queen's Walk","locality":"Bankside","postcode":"SE1 9TG"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7887 8000","text":"information & bookings","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7887 8000"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.tate.org.uk/modern"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"St Paul’s, Southwark or London Bridge"}],"review":{"summary":"The public’s love affair with this phenomenally successful modern art gallery shows no sign of waning a decade after it opened. Serious art critics have occasionally swiped at its populism, particularly the ‘participatory art’ exhibited in the Turbine Hall (Carl Höller’s funfair-like slides called <em>Test Site;</em> Olafur Eliasson’s arm-flapping <em>The Weather Project;</em> Doris Salcedo’s enormous crack in the floor called <em>Shibboleth</em> and <em>Bodyspacemotionthing;</em> and Robert Morris’ climbable geometric sculpture first exhibited in London in 1971 and recreated here in 2009). But an average five million visitors a year appear to disagree, making it the world’s most popular contemporary art gallery and – almost unbelievably – the most visited sight in London, just ahead of the British Museum. The critics are right in one sense, though: this ‘Tate Modern effect’ is really more about the building and its location than about the mostly 20th-century art inside. Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for their transformation of the empty Bankside Power Station, which was built between 1947 and 1963 and closed in 1981. Leaving the building’s single central chimney, adding a two-storey glass box onto the roof and using the vast Turbine Hall as a dramatic entrance space were three strokes of genius. Then, of course, there are the wonderful views of the Thames and St Paul’s, particularly from the restaurant-bar on the 7th level and the espresso bar on the 4th. There’s also a cafe on the 2nd level, plus places to relax overlooking the Turbine Hall. An 11-storey sloping brick extension to the southwest corner, by the same architects, will be completed in 2012. Tate Modern’s permanent collection on levels 3 and 5 is now arranged by both theme and chronology. States of Flux is devoted to early-20th-century avant-garde movements, including cubism and futurism. Poetry and Dream examines surrealism through various themes and techniques. Material Gestures features European and American painting and sculpture of the 1940s and ‘50s. The new Energy and Pro-cess gallery will have Arte Povera, revolutionary art of the 1960s, as its main focus. More than 60, 000 works are on constant rotation here, and the curators have at their disposal paintings by Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Roy Lichtenstein and Jackson Pollock, as well as pieces by Joseph Beuys, Marcel Duchamp, Damien Hirst, Rebecca Horn, Claes Oldenburg and Auguste Rodin. Special exhibitions (level 4) in the past have included retrospectives on Edward Hopper, Frida Kahlo, August Strindberg, Nazism and ‘Degenerate’ Art, local ‘bad boys’ Gilbert &amp; George and the Russian constructivists Aleksandr Rodchenko and Liubov Popova. <strong>Audioguides</strong>, with four different tours, are available for £2. Free <strong>guided highlights tours</strong> depart at 11am, noon, 2pm and 3pm daily. The <strong>Tate Boat</strong> operates between the Bankside Pier at Tate Modern and the Millbank Pier at its sister-museum <strong>Tate Britain</strong>. Services from the latter depart from 10.30am to 5.10pm daily also at 40-minute intervals.

The order moved here around 1160, abandoning its older headquarters in Holborn. Today the sprawling oasis of fine buildings and pleasant traffic-free green space is home to two Inns of Court (housing the chambers of lawyers practising in the City), the Middle and the Lesser Temple. The Temple Church has a distinctive design: the Round (consecrated in 1185 and designed to recall the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem) adjoins the Chancel (built in 1240), which is the heart of the modern church. Both parts were severely damaged by a bomb in 1941 and have been lovingly reconstructed. Its most obvious points of interest are the life-size stone effigies of nine knights that lie on the floor of the Round. These include the Earl of Pembroke, who acted as the go-between for King John and the rebel barons, eventually leading to the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. In recent years the church has become a must-see for readers of <em>The Da Vinci Code,</em> in which a key scene was set here. Check opening times in advance as they change frequently.

The silver roofs on the piers house the operating machinery to raise and lower the gates against excess water. They make a surreal sight, straddling the river in the lee of a giant warehouse. The reason why London needs such a flood barrier is that the water level has been rising by as much as 60cm per century, while the river itself has been narrowing; in Roman times it was probably around 800m wide at the site of today’s London Bridge while now it’s barely 250m, with constant pressure to develop the foreshores. The Thames tide rises and falls quite harmlessly twice a day, and once a fortnight there’s also a stronger ‘spring’ tide. The danger comes when the spring tide coincides with an unexpected surge, which pushes tons of extra water upriver. The barrier has been built to prevent that water pouring over the riverbanks and flooding nearby houses. Today environmentalists are already talking about a bigger, wider damming mechanism further towards the mouth of the river, before the current barrier comes to the expected end of its design life in 2030.

Its grandiose stone houses, built by the nobility, counted as some of the most prestigious places to live, sitting as they did on a street that connected the City and Westminster, the two centres of power; indeed, its appeal lasted for seven centuries, with the 19th-century prime minister Benjamin Disraeli pronouncing it ‘the finest street in Europe’. Buildings included the now-no-more Cecil Hotel, the Savoy hotel, Simpson’s, King’s College and Somerset House. But modern times haven’t treated The Strand with the same sort of respect and awe: the street is now overrun by offices, cheap restaurants and odd souvenir shops, and despite the fact that the Savoy (which is mid-refurbishment at the time of writing), the building formerly Simpson’s and the wonderful Somerset House still grace the street, it is hardly seen as the fine drag it once was. Still, there are some lovely things to see here, such as <strong>Twinings</strong> at No 216, a teashop opened by Thomas Twining in 1706 and believed to be the oldest company in the capital still trading on the same site and owned by the same family.

Despite ever-growing ticket prices and the hordes of tourists that descend here in the summer months, this is one of those rare pleasures: somewhere worth the hype. Throughout the ages, murder and political skulduggery have reigned as much as kings and queens, so tales of imprisonment and executions will pepper your trail. The Tower is in fact a castle, and not towerlike at all (although in the Middle Ages it’s easy to imagine how the White Tower would have dwarfed the huts of the peasantry surrounding the castle walls) and has been the property (and sometime London residence) of the monarch since it was begun during the reign of William the Conqueror (1066–87). By far the best preserved medieval castle in London, it’s one of the capital’s four Unesco World Heritage Sites (the others are Westminster Abbey, Kew Gardens and Maritime Greenwich), and will fascinate anyone with any interest at all in history, the monarchy and warfare. With more than two million visitors a year, this place is seriously crowded in the high season so it’s best to buy a ticket in advance, and to visit later in the day. You can buy Tower tickets online (for a £1 discount), or at any tube station up to a week beforehand, which can save you a lot of time when you arrive. Also, after 3pm the groups have usually left and the place is a lot more pleasant to stroll around. During the winter months it’s far less crowded, so there’s no need to take either of these precautions. Your best bet is to start with a free hour-long tour given by the Yeoman Warders, which is a great way to bring the various parts of the tower to life. The Yeoman Warders have been guarding the tower since 1485, and have all served a minimum of 22 years in the British Armed Forces. Known affectionately as ‘beefeaters’ by the public (due to the large rations of beef given to them in the past), there are 35 Yeoman Warders today, including Moira Cameron, the first ever female beefeater, who began serving in 2007. While officially they guard the tower and Crown Jewels at night, their main role today is as tour guides (and to pose for photographs with curious foreigners). These tours leave from the Middle Tower every 30 minutes from 9.30am (10am on Sunday) to 3.30pm (2.30pm in winter) daily. The warders also conduct about eight different short talks (35 minutes) and tours (45 minutes) on specific themes. The first is at 9.30am Monday to Saturday (10.15am on Sunday in summer, 11.30am in winter), the last at 5.15pm (3pm in winter). Less theatrical are the self-paced audioguides available in nine languages for £4 from the information point on Water Lane. You enter the tower via the <strong>West Gate</strong> and proceed across the walkway over the dry moat between the <strong>Middle Tower</strong> and <strong>Byward Tower</strong>. The original moat was finally drained of centuries of festering sewage in the 19th century, necessitated by persistent cholera outbreaks, and a superbly manicured lawn now takes its place. Before you stands the <strong>Bell Tower</strong>, housing the curfew bells and one-time home to Thomas More. The politician and author of <em>Utopia</em> was imprisoned here in 1534 before his execution for refusing to recognise King Henry VIII as head of the Church of England in place of the Pope. To your left are the <strong>casements of the former Royal Mint</strong>, which were moved from this site to new buildings northeast of the castle in 1812. Continuing past the Bell Tower along <strong>Water Lane</strong> between the walls you come to the famous <strong>Traitors’ Gate</strong>, the gateway through which prisoners being brought by river entered the tower. Above the gate, rooms inside <strong>St Thomas’s Tower</strong> show what the hall and bedchamber of Edward I (1272–1307) might once have looked like. Here also archaeologists have peeled back the layers of newer buildings to find what went before. Opposite St Thomas’s Tower is <strong>Wakefield Tower</strong>, built by Henry III between 1220 and 1240. Its upper floor is actually entered via St Thomas’s Tower and has been even more enticingly furnished with a replica throne and huge candelabra to give an impression of how, as an anteroom in a medieval palace, it might have once looked in Edward I’s day. During the 15th-century War of the Roses between the Houses of Lancaster and York, Henry VI was almost certainly murdered in this tower. Below, in the basement of Wakefield Tower, there’s a <strong>Torture at the Tower</strong> exhibition. However, torture wasn’t practised as much in England as it was on the Continent apparently, and the display is pretty perfunctory, limiting itself to a rack, a pair of manacles and an instrument for keeping prisoners doubled up called a Scavenger’s Daughter. Frankly, you’d see scarier gear at any London S&amp;M club (or the London Dungeon, across the river near London Bridge). To get to this exhibition and the basement level of Wakefield Tower, enter the tower courtyard through the arch opposite Traitors’ Gate. As you do so, you’ll also observe at the centre of the courtyard the Norman <strong>White Tower</strong> with a turret on each of its four corners and a golden weather vane spinning atop each. This tower has a couple of remnants of Norman architecture, including a fireplace and garderobe (lavatory). However, most of its interior is given over to a collection of cannons, guns and suits of armour for men and horses, which come from the Royal Armouries in Leeds. Among the most remarkable exhibits are the 2m suit of armour made for John of Gaunt (to see that coming towards you on a battlefield must have been terrifying) and alongside it a tiny child’s suit of armour designed for James I’s young son, Henry. Another unmissable suit is that of Henry VIII, a virtually cuboid shape to match the monarch’s bloated body in his 40s, and featuring what must have been the most impressive posing pouch in the kingdom. The stretch of green between the Wakefield and White Towers is where the Tower’s famous <strong>ravens</strong> are found. According to legend, if these birds leave the Tower it would presage the fall of the kingdom, so their wings are clipped to ensure this will never happen. Watching them being fed chunks of meat is a fascinating sight. Opposite Wakefield Tower and the White Tower is the <strong>Bloody Tower</strong>, with an exhibition on Elizabethan adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh, who was imprisoned here three times by the capricious Elizabeth I, most significantly from 1605 to 1616. The Bloody Tower acquired its nickname from the story that the ‘princes in the tower’, Edward V and his younger brother, were murdered here to annul their claims to the throne. The blame is usually laid at the door of their uncle Richard III, although Henry VII might also have been responsible for the crime. Beside the Bloody Tower sits a collection of black-and-white half-timbered Tudor houses that are home to Tower of London staff. The <strong>Queen’s House</strong>, where Anne Boleyn lived out her final days in 1536, now houses the resident governor and is closed to the public. North of the Queen’s House, across <strong>Tower Green</strong>, is the <strong>scaffold site</strong>, where seven people were executed by beheading in Tudor times: two of Henry VIII’s six wives, the alleged adulterers Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard; the latter’s lady-in-waiting, Jane Rochford; Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury, descended from the House of York; 16-year-old Lady Jane Grey, who fell foul of Henry’s daughter Mary I by being her rival for the throne; William, Lord Hastings; and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, once a favourite of Elizabeth I. These people were executed within the tower precincts largely to spare the monarch the embarrassment of the usual public execution on Tower Hill, an event that was usually attended by thousands of spectators. In the case of Robert Devereux, the authorities perhaps also feared a popular uprising in his support. Behind the scaffold site is the <strong>Beauchamp Tower</strong>, where high-ranking prisoners including Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey were jailed and where fascinating, unhappy inscriptions from the condemned are on display today. Behind the scaffold site lies the <strong>Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula</strong> (St Peter in Chains), a rare example of ecclesiastical Tudor architecture and the burial place of those beheaded on the scaffold outside or at nearby Tower Hill. Unfortunately, it can only be visited on a group tour or after 4.30pm, so if you aren’t already part of a group hang around until one shows up and then tag along. Alternatively, attend a service, which takes place at 9am on Sunday. To the east of the chapel and north of the White Tower is the building that visitors most want to see: <strong>Waterloo Barracks</strong>, the home of the <strong>Crown Jewels</strong>. You file past footage of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation backed by stirring patriotic music before you reach the vault itself (check out the doors as you go in – they look like they’d survive a nuclear attack). Once inside you’ll be confronted with ornate sceptres, plates, orbs and, naturally, crowns. A very slow-moving travelator takes you past the dozen or so crowns that are the centrepiece, including the £27.5 million Imperial State Crown, set with diamonds (2868 of them to be exact), sapphires, emeralds, rubies and pearls, and the platinum crown of the late Queen Mother, Elizabeth, which is famously set with the 105-carat Koh-i-Noor (Mountain of Light) diamond. Surrounded by myth and legend, the 14th-century diamond has been claimed by both India and Afghanistan. It reputedly confers enormous power on its owner, but male owners are destined to die a tormented death. The Crown Jewels display will be redesigned in time for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012, although exactly when this will happen was unclear at the time of writing. Behind the Waterloo Barracks is the <strong>Bowyer Tower</strong>, where George, Duke of Clarence, brother and rival of Edward IV, was imprisoned and, according to a long-standing legend that has never been proved, was drowned in a barrel of malmsey (sweet Madeira wine). The <strong>Fusiliers Museum</strong> to the east of Waterloo Barracks is run by the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. It covers the history of the Royal Fusiliers dating back to 1685, and has models of several battles. A 10-minute video gives details of the modern regiment. The red-brick <strong>New Armouries</strong> in the southeastern corner of the inner courtyard houses the <strong>New Armouries Café</strong> where you can grab a pricey sandwich or soup lunch. There are plenty of other attractions, as well as churches, shops and toilets within the tower complex, but before you leave you should walk along the inner ramparts. This <strong>Wall Walk</strong> begins with the 13th-century <strong>Salt Tower</strong>, probably used to store saltpetre for gunpowder, and takes in <strong>Broad Arrow Tower</strong>, which houses an exhibit about the gunpowder plotters imprisoned here, many of their original inscriptions having been discovered on the walls. The walk ends at the <strong>Martin Tower</strong>, which houses an exhibition about the original coronation regalia. Here you can see some of the older crowns, whose jewels have been removed. The oldest surviving crown is that of George I, which is topped with the ball and cross from James II’s crown. It was from the Martin Tower that Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal the Crown Jewels in 1671, disguised as a clergyman. Finally, for those interested in the obscure ritual and ceremony of the British monarchy, the Key Ceremony takes place every evening at 9.30pm. This elaborate locking of the main gates makes the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace look like a recently invented tourist trick – the guards have been performing the ceremony every day without fail for more than 600 years. Even when a bomb hit the Tower of London during the Blitz, the ceremony was only delayed by 30 minutes, which everyone agrees is the essence of the famed stiff upper lip. Entry to the ceremony is free but, in a suitably antiquated style, you have to apply for tickets by post as demand is so high. See the website for details. There is limited disabled access to the tower. Call ahead for more information."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/372009","id":"372009","name":"Tracey Neuls","type":"Shop","subtype":"Books","latitude":51.51670695,"longitude":-0.150851255,"hours":"11:00-18:30 Mon-Fri, to 20:30 Thu, 12:00-17:00 Sat","address":{"street":"29 Marylebone Lane","locality":"Marylebone","postcode":"W1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7935 0039","text":"tel, info","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7935 0039"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.tn29.com"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Bond St"}],"review":{"summary":"<p>A great-looking shoe shop - with bookshelves full of knick-knacks, and boots, shoes and sandals hanging on strings from the ceiling - this is the place to come for unique footwear.

The great square was neglected over many years, ringed with gnarling traffic and given over to flocks of pigeons that would dive-bomb anyone with a morsel of food on their person. But things changed in 2000 when Ken Livingstone became London Mayor and embarked on a bold and imaginative scheme to transform it into the kind of space John Nash had intended when he designed it in the early 19th century. Traffic was banished from the northern flank in front of the National Gallery, and a new pedestrian plaza built. The front of the National Gallery itself was dolled up with a new facade and entrance hall, and feeding pigeons was banned. Countless cultural events are held here, showcasing the city’s multiculturalism, with celebrations for Russian, Jewish and Chinese New Year, plus African music concerts, film screenings and so on. In recent years, Trafalgar Sq has become a top protest venue too, with demonstrations against the conflicts in Gaza, Sri Lanka and other international hot potatoes taking place here. The website www.london.gov.uk/trafalgarsquare allows you to see what events are taking place on the square. The pedestrianisation has made it easier to appreciate not only the square but also the splendid buildings around it: the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery and the newly renovated church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The ceremonial <strong>Pall Mall</strong> runs southwest from the top of the square. To the southwest stands <strong>Admiralty Arch</strong>, with The Mall leading to Buckingham Palace beyond it. To the west is <strong>Canada House</strong> (1827), designed by Robert Smirke. Standing in the centre of the square since 1843, the 52m-high <strong>Nelson’s Column</strong> (upon which the admiral surveys his fleet of ships to the southwest) commemorates Nelson’s victory over Napoleon off Cape Trafalgar in Spain in 1805."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371467","id":"371467","name":"Trafalgar Tavern","type":"Night","subtype":"Pub","latitude":51.4849908094899,"longitude":-0.0030899047852,"hours":"noon-11pm Mon-Thu, to midnight Fri & Sat, to 10.30pm Sun","address":{"street":"6 Park Row","postcode":"SE10"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8858 2437","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8858 2437"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.trafalgartavern.co.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"train","description":"Greenwich"}],"review":{"summary":"This cavernous pub with big windows looking onto the Thames and the O2 (the erstwhile Millennium Dome) is steeped in history and you can see some of it illustrated in the prints on the walls.

It was part of Prince Albert’s legacy to the nation in the aftermath of the successful Great Exhibition of 1851, and its original aims – which still hold today – were the ‘improvement of public taste in design’ and ‘applications of fine art to objects of utility’. It’s done a fine job so far. As you enter under the stunning blue-and-yellow blown glass <strong>chandelier by Dale Chihuly</strong> you can pick up a museum map (free; £1 donation requested) at the information desk. (If the ‘Grand Entrance’ on Cromwell Rd is too busy, there’s another around the corner on Exhibition Rd.) Consider one of the free <strong>introductory guided tours</strong>, which last 45 minutes to an hour and leave the main reception area every hour from 10.30am to 3.30pm. Spread over 145 galleries, the museum houses the world’s greatest collection of <strong>decorative arts</strong>, including ancient Chinese ceramics, modernist architectural drawings, Korean bronze and Japanese swords, <strong>cartoons by Raphael</strong>, spellbinding Asian and Islamic art, Rodin sculptures, gowns from the Elizabethan era, dresses straight from this year’s Paris fashion shows, ancient jewellery, a 1930s wireless set – and a lot more. Choose the section(s) you want to visit and stick to that plan. Level 1 – the floor at street level – is mostly devoted to art and design from India, China, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, as well as European art. The museum has the best collection of Italian Renaissance sculpture outside Italy, as well as excellent French, German and Spanish pieces. One of the museum’s highlights are the <strong>Cast Courts</strong> in room 46a, containing plaster casts collected in the Victorian era, such as Michelangelo’s David, which was acquired in 1858. The museum’s then director, Henry Cole, commissioned casts of Europe’s finest works to be used by art students. The <strong>Photography collection</strong> (room 38a) is one of the country’s best, with more than 500, 000 images collected since 1852. Among the highlights are the 19th-century photographs of London by Lady Clementina Hawarden. Room 40, the museum’s <strong>Fashion Room</strong>, is among the most popular, with displays ranging from Elizabethan costumes to Vivienne Westwood gowns, dated 1980s Armani outfits and designs from this year’s catwalks. A fascinating display of women’s undergarments shows the ‘progress’ from the stifling and life-endangering corsets from Victorian times to present-day Agent Provocateur’s sexy (and comfortable) versions. The <strong>Jameel Gallery</strong> (room 42) contains more than 400 objects from the Islamic Middle East, including ceramics, textiles, carpets, glass and woodwork from the 8th-century caliphate up to the years before WWI. The pieces were collected from Spain to Afghanistan, though the exhibition’s highlight is the gorgeous mid-16th-century <strong>Ardabil Carpet</strong>, the world’s oldest (and one of the largest) dated carpet, from Iran. The landscaped <strong>John Madejski Garden</strong> is a lovely shaded inner courtyard where you can collect your thoughts. Cross it to reach the original <strong>Refreshment Rooms</strong> dating from the 1860s (Morris, Gamble and Poynter Rooms) and redesigned by McInnes Usher McKnight Architects (MUMA) in 2006. MUMA has also renovated the V&amp;A’s <strong>Medieval and Renaissance galleries</strong> which are now located to the right of the Grand Entrance. The <strong>British Galleries</strong>, featuring every aspect of British design from 1500 to 1900, are on levels 2 and 4. They include Henry VIII’s writing desk and the so-called Great Bed of Ware from the late 16th century, big enough to sleep five and designed as an early advertising gimmick for an inn in Hertfordshire. Shakespeare mentions it in <em>Twelfth Night</em>. The <strong>Architecture gallery</strong> (rooms 127 to 128a) is also on level 4, with descriptions of architectural styles, videos, models and plans. In rooms 70 to 73 on level 4 is part of the <strong>Gilbert Collection</strong> of gold, silver, mosaics, gold boxes and enamel miniatures, which was housed in <strong>Somerset House</strong> until 2008. The V&amp;A’s temporary exhibitions – such as 2007’s Kylie (as in Minogue), 2008’s Cold War Modern Design: 1945–70 and 2009’s Hats by mad milliner Stephen Jones – are compelling, fun and bring lots of visitors (note that admission fees apply), so check the website to find out what’s on. The V&amp;A also has an excellent program of talks, workshops and events, plus one of the best museum shops around."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371087","id":"371087","name":"Victoria Park","type":"See","subtype":"Outdoors","latitude":51.5384880228426,"longitude":-0.0371646881104,"hours":"dawn-dusk","address":{"street":"Grove Rd","locality":"Bow","postcode":"E3"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"8985 1957","click_to_dial":"+44 20 8985 1957"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.towerhamlets.gov.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Mile End,"},{"type":"bus","description":"277 or 425"}],"review":{"summary":"If you want a little more green than Mile End Park affords, head north from Mile End tube along Grove Rd, until you reach 88-hectare Victoria Park, the ‘Regent’s Park of the East End’.

Even though it was abysmally late and cost twice the original budget (at £798 million, one of the most expensive stadium ever built), Wembley is one of the world’s most significant football landmarks."},"map-visible":false}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/372003","id":"372003","name":"West End Theatre","type":"See","subtype":"Entertainment","latitude":51.5159136112365,"longitude":-0.1358914375305,"address":{"street":"West End","locality":"Soho"},"telephones":[],"emails":[],"urls":[],"transports":[],"review":{"summary":"<p>There are some 50 theatres in London's West End, so you'll need a listings guide like www.timeout.com or www.whatsonstage.com for the latest productions.

With the exception of Edward V and Edward VIII, every English sovereign has been crowned here since William the Conqueror in 1066, and most of the monarchs from Henry III (died 1272) to George II (died 1760) were also buried here. There is an extraordinary amount to see here but, unless you enjoy feeling like part of a herd, come very early or very late. The abbey is a magnificent sight. Though a mixture of architectural styles, it is considered the finest example of Early English Gothic (1180–1280). The original church was built in the 11th century by King (later St) Edward the Confessor, who is buried in the chapel behind the main altar. Henry III (r 1216–72) began work on the new building but didn’t complete it; the French Gothic nave was finished in 1388. Henry VII’s huge and magnificent chapel was added in 1519. Unlike St Paul’s, Westminster Abbey has never been a cathedral – it is what is called a ‘royal peculiar’ and is administered directly by the Crown. It is perhaps more impressive from outside than within. The interior is chock-a-block with small chapels, elaborate tombs of the monarchy, and monuments to various luminaries down through the ages. And, as you might expect for one of the most visited churches in Christendom, it can get intolerably busy. Immediately past the barrier through the north door is what’s known as <strong>Statesmen’s Aisle</strong>, where politicians and eminent public figures are commemorated mostly by staggeringly large marble statues. The Whig and Tory prime ministers who dominated late Victorian politics, Gladstone (who is buried here) and Disraeli (who is not), have their monuments uncomfortably close to one another. Nearby is a monument to Robert Peel, who, as home secretary in 1829, created the Metropolitan Police. Robert’s policemen became known as ‘Bobby’s boys’ and later, simply, ‘bobbies’. At the eastern end of the sanctuary, opposite the entrance to the Henry VII Chapel, is the rather ordinary-looking <strong>Coronation Chair</strong>, upon which almost every monarch since the late 13th century is said to have been crowned. Up the steps in front of you and to your left is the narrow <strong>Queen Elizabeth Chapel</strong>, where Elizabeth I and her half-sister ‘Bloody Mary’ share an elaborate tomb. The <strong>Henry VII Chapel</strong>, in the easternmost part of the abbey, has spectacular circular vaulting on the ceiling. Behind the chapel’s altar is the elaborate sarcophagus of Henry VII and his queen, Elizabeth of York. Beyond the chapel’s altar is the <strong>Royal Air Force (RAF) Chapel</strong>, with a stained-glass window commemorating the force’s finest hour, the Battle of Britain. Next to it, a plaque marks the spot where Oliver Cromwell’s body lay for two years until the Restoration, when it was disinterred, hanged and beheaded. The bodies believed to be those of the two child princes (allegedly) murdered in the Tower of London in 1483 are buried here. The chapel’s southern aisle contains the <strong>tomb of Mary Queen of Scots</strong>, beheaded on the orders of her cousin Elizabeth and with the acquiescence of her son, the future James I. The <strong>Chapel of St Edward the Confessor</strong>, the most sacred spot in the abbey, lies just east of the sanctuary and behind the high altar; access may be restricted to protect the 13th-century floor. St Edward was the founder of the abbey and the original building was consecrated a few weeks before his death. His tomb was slightly altered after the original was destroyed during the Reformation. The south transept contains <strong>Poets’ Corner</strong>, where many of England’s finest writers are buried and/or commemorated; a memorial here is the highest honour the Queen can bestow. Just north is the <strong>Lantern</strong>, the heart of the abbey, where coronations take place. If you face eastwards while standing in the centre, the sanctuary is in front of you. George Gilbert Scott designed the ornate high altar in 1897. Behind you, Edward Blore’s chancel, dating from the mid-19th century, is a breathtaking structure of gold, blue and red Victorian Gothic. Where monks once worshipped, boys from the Choir School and lay vicars now sing the daily services. The entrance to the <strong>Cloister</strong> is 13th century, while the cloister itself dates from the 14th. Eastwards down a passageway off the Cloister are three museums run by English Heritage. The octagonal <strong>Chapter House</strong> has one of Europe’s best-preserved medieval tile floors and retains traces of religious murals. It was used as a meeting place by the House of Commons in the second half of the 14th century. To the right of the entrance to Chapel House is what is claimed to be the oldest door in the UK – it’s been there 950 years. The adjacent <strong>Pyx Chamber</strong> is one of the few remaining relics of the original abbey and contains the abbey’s treasures and liturgical objects. The <strong>Abbey Museum</strong> exhibits the death masks of generations of royalty, wax effigies representing Charles II and William III (who is on a stool to make him as tall as his wife Mary), as well as armour and stained glass. To reach the 900-year-old <strong>College Garden</strong>, enter Dean’s Yard and the Little Cloisters off Great College St. On the western side of the cloister is <strong>Scientists’ Corner</strong>, where you will find <strong>Sir Isaac Newton’s tomb</strong>; a nearby section of the northern aisle of the nave is known as <strong>Musicians’ Aisle</strong>. The two towers above the west door are the ones through which you exit. These were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and completed in 1745. Just above the door, perched in 15th-century niches, are the latest sacred additions to the abbey: 10 stone statues of international 20th-century martyrs. These were unveiled in 1998 and they include the likes of Martin Luther King and the Polish priest St Maximilian Kolbe, who was murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz. To the right as you exit is a memorial to innocent victims of oppression, violence and war around the world. ‘All you who pass by, is it nothing to you?’ it asks poignantly. The 90-minute <strong>guided tours</strong> leave several times during the day (Monday to Saturday). One of the best ways to visit the abbey is to attend a service, particularly evensong (5pm weekdays, 3pm at weekends). Sunday Eucharist is at 11am."},"map-visible":true}},{"poi":{"about":"http://atlas.prod.lpo/pois/371781","id":"371781","name":"Westminster Cathedral","type":"See","subtype":"Food","latitude":51.4959731440671,"longitude":-0.1394748687744,"hours":"cathedral 7am-7pm, tower 9.30am-12.30pm & 1-5pm daily Apr-Nov, Thu-Sun Dec-Mar","price_string":"cathedral admission free, tower adult/concession/family £5/2.50/11","address":{"street":"Victoria St","postcode":"SW1"},"telephones":[{"area_code":"020","number":"7798 9055","click_to_dial":"+44 20 7798 9055"}],"emails":[],"urls":["www.westminstercathedral.org.uk"],"transports":[{"type":"underground rail","description":"Victoria"}],"review":{"summary":"John Francis Bentley’s 19th-century cathedral, mother church of Roman Catholicism in England and Wales, is a superb example of neo-Byzantine architecture with its distinctive candy-striped red-brick and white-stone tower features.
